    "# Build a semantic search engine\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial will familiarize you with LangChain's [document loader](/docs/concepts/document_loaders), [embedding](/docs/concepts/embedding_models), and [vector store](/docs/concepts/vectorstores) abstractions. These abstractions are designed to support retrieval of data--  from (vector) databases and other sources--  for integration with LLM workflows. They are important for applications that fetch data to be reasoned over as part of model inference, as in the case of retrieval-augmented generation, or [RAG](/docs/concepts/rag) (see our RAG tutorial [here](/docs/tutorials/rag)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will build a search engine over a PDF document. This will allow us to retrieve passages in the PDF that are similar to an input query.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "This guide focuses on retrieval of text data. We will cover the following concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Documents and document loaders;\n",
    "- Text splitters;\n",
    "- Embeddings;\n",
    "- Vector stores and retrievers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "### Jupyter Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "This and other tutorials are perhaps most conveniently run in a Jupyter notebook. See [here](https://jupyter.org/install) for instructions on how to install.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Installation\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial requires the `langchain-community` and `pypdf` packages:\n",
    "\n",
    "import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';\n",
    "import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';\n",
    "import CodeBlock from \"@theme/CodeBlock\";\n",

    "### LangSmith\n",
    "\n",
    "Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls.\n",
    "As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent.\n",
    "The best way to do this is with [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com).\n",
    "\n",
    "After you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces:\n",
    "\n",
    "```shell\n",
    "export LANGSMITH_TRACING=\"true\"\n",
    "export LANGSMITH_API_KEY=\"...\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, if in a notebook, you can set them with:\n",

    "```python\n",
    "import getpass\n",
    "import os\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "LangChain implements a [Document](https://python.langchain.com/api_reference/core/documents/langchain_core.documents.base.Document.html) abstraction, which is intended to represent a unit of text and associated metadata. It has three attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `page_content`: a string representing the content;\n",
    "- `metadata`: a dict containing arbitrary metadata;\n",
    "- `id`: (optional) a string identifier for the document.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `metadata` attribute can capture information about the source of the document, its relationship to other documents, and other information. Note that an individual `Document` object often represents a chunk of a larger document.\n",

Bars of sunlight cast through rents in the walls made motes of dust glitter\\nwhere they yet hung in the air. Scorch-marks marred the walls, the floors, the ceilings. Broad black\\nsmears crossed the blistered paints and gilt of once-bright murals, soot overlaying crumbling friezes\\nof men and animals which seemed to have attempted to walk before the madness grew quiet. The\\ndead lay everywhere, men and women and children, struck down in attempted flight by the lightnings\\nthat had flashed down every corridor, or seized by the fires that had stalked them, or sunken into stone\\nof the palace, the stones that had flowed and sought, almost alive, before stillness came again. In odd\\ncounterpoint, colorful tapestries and paintings, masterworks all, hung undisturbed except where\\nbulging walls had pushed them awry. Finely carved furnishings, inlaid with ivory and gold, stood\\nuntouched except where rippling floors had toppled them. The mind-twisting had struck at the core,\\nignoring peripheral things.\\nLews Therin Telamon wandered the palace, deftly keeping his balance when the earth heaved.\\n“Ilyena! My love, where are you?” The edge of his pale gray cloak trailed through blood as he\\nstepped across the body of a woman, her golden-haired beauty marred by the horror of her last\\nmoments, her still-open eyes frozen in disbelief. “Where are you, my wife? Where is everyone\\nhiding?”\\nHis eyes caught his own reflection in a mirror hanging askew from bubbled marble. His clothes\\nhad been regal once, in gray and scarlet and gold; now the finely-woven cloth, brought by merchants\\nfrom across the World Sea, was torn and dirty, thick with the same dust that covered his hair and skin.\\nFor a moment he fingered the symbol on his cloak, a circle half white and half black, the colors\\nseparated by a sinuous line. It meant something, that symbol. But the embroidered circle could not\\nhold his attention long. He gazed at his own image with as much wonder. A tall man just into his\\nmiddle years, handsome once, but now with hair already more white than brown and a face lined by\\nstrain and worry, dark eyes that had seen too much. Lews Therin began to chuckle, then threw back\\nhis head; his laughter echoed down the lifeless halls.\\n“Ilyena, my love! Come to me, my wife. You must see this.”\\nBehind him the air rippled, shimmered, solidified into a man who looked around, his mouth\\ntwisting briefly with distaste. Not so tall as Lews Therin, he was clothed all in black, save for the\\nsnow-white lace at his throat and the silverwork on the turned-down tops of his thigh-high boots. He\\nstepped carefully, handling his cloak fastidiously to avoid brushing the dead. The floor trembled with\\naftershocks, but his attention was fixed on the man staring into the mirror and laughing.\\n“Lord of the Morning,” he said, “I have come for you.”\\nThe laughter cut off as if it had never been, and Lews Therin turned, seeming unsurprised. “Ah, a\\nguest. Have you the Voice, stranger? It will soon be time for the Singing, and here all are welcome to\\ntake part. Ilyena, my love, we have a guest. Ilyena, where are you?”\\nThe black-clad man’s eyes widened, darted to the body of the golden-haired woman, then back\\nto Lews Therin. “Shai’tan take you, does the taint already have you so far in its grip?”'),\n",

Shai—” Lews Therin shuddered and raised a hand as though to ward off something.\\n“You mustn’t say that name. It is dangerous.”\\n“So you remember that much, at least. Dangerous for you, fool, not for me. What else do you\\nremember? Remember, you Light-blinded idiot! I will not let it end with you swaddled in\\nunawareness! Remember!”\\nFor a moment Lews Therin stared at his raised hand, fascinated by the patterns of grime. Then he\\nwiped his hand on his even dirtier coat and turned his attention back to the other man. “Who are you?\\nWhat do you want?”\\nThe black-clad man drew himself up arrogantly. “Once I was called Elan Morin Tedronai, but\\nnow—”\\n“Betrayer of Hope.” It was a whisper from Lews Therin. Memory stirred, but he turned his head,\\nshying away from it.\\n“So you do remember some things. Yes, Betrayer of Hope. So have men named me, just as they\\nnamed you Dragon, but unlike you I embrace the name. They gave me the name to revile me, but I will\\nyet make them kneel and worship it. What will you do with your name? After this day, men will call\\nyou Kinslayer. What will you do with that?”\\nLews Therin frowned down the ruined hall. “Ilyena should be here to offer a guest welcome,” he\\nmurmured absently, then raised his voice. “Ilyena, where are you?” The floor shook; the golden-\\nhaired woman’s body shifted as if in answer to his call. His eyes did not see her.\\nElan Morin grimaced. “Look at you,” he said scornfully. “Once you stood first among the\\nServants. Once you wore the Ring of Tamyrlin, and sat in the High Seat. Once you summoned the\\nNine Rods of Dominion. Now look at you! A pitiful, shattered wretch. But it is not enough. You\\nhumbled me in the Hall of Servants. You defeated me at the Gates of Paaran Disen. But I am the\\ngreater, now. I will not let you die without knowing that. When you die, your last thought will be the\\nfull knowledge of your defeat, of how complete and utter it is. If I let you die at all.”\\n“I cannot imagine what is keeping Ilyena. She will give me the rough side of her tongue if she\\nthinks I have been hiding a guest from her. I hope you enjoy conversation, for she surely does. Be\\nforewarned. Ilyena will ask you so many questions you may end up telling her everything you know.”\\nTossing back his black cloak, Elan Morin flexed his hands. “A pity for you,” he mused, “that one\\nof your Sisters is not here. I was never very skilled at Healing, and I follow a different power now.\\nBut even one of them could only give you a few lucid minutes, if you did not destroy her first. What I\\ncan do will serve as well, for my purposes.” His sudden smile was cruel. “But I fear Shai’tan’s\\nhealing is different from the sort you know. Be healed, Lews Therin!” He extended his hands, and the\\nlight dimmed as if a shadow had been laid across the sun.\\nPain blazed in Lews Therin, and he screamed, a scream that came from his depths, a scream he\\ncould not stop. Fire seared his marrow; acid rushed along his veins. He toppled backwards, crashing\\nto the marble floor; his head struck the stone and rebounded. His heart pounded, trying to beat its way\\nout of his chest, and every pulse gushed new flame through him. Helplessly he convulsed, thrashing,\\nhis skull a sphere of purest agony on the point of bursting. His hoarse screams reverberated through\\nthe palace.\\nSlowly, ever so slowly, the pain receded. The outflowing seemed to take a thousand years and\\nleft him twitching weakly, sucking breath through a raw throat. Another thousand years seemed to\\npass before he could manage to heave himself over, muscles like jellyfish, and shakily push himself\\nup on hands and knees. His eyes fell on the golden-haired woman, and the scream that was ripped out\\nof him dwarfed every sound he had made before. Tottering, almost falling, he scrabbled brokenly'),\n",

It took every bit of his strength to pull her up into his arms. His hands shook as\\nhe smoothed her hair back from her staring face.\\n“Ilyena! Light help me, Ilyena!” His body curved around hers protectively, his sobs the full-\\nthroated cries of a man who had nothing left to live for. “Ilyena, no! \\nNo!\\n”\\n“You can have her back, Kinslayer. The Great Lord of the Dark can make her live again, if you\\nwill serve him. If you will serve me.”\\nLews Therin raised his head, and the black-clad man took an involuntary step back from that\\ngaze. “Ten years, Betrayer,” Lews Therin said softly, the soft sound of steel being bared. “Ten years\\nyour foul master has wracked the world. And now this. I will. . . .”\\n“Ten years! You pitiful fool! This war has not lasted ten years, but since the beginning of time.\\nYou and I have fought a thousand battles with the turning of the Wheel, a thousand times a thousand,\\nand we will fight until time dies and the Shadow is triumphant!” He finished in a shout, with a raised\\nfist, and it was Lews Therin’s turn to pull back, breath catching at the glow in the Betrayer’s eyes.\\nCarefully Lews Therin laid Ilyena down, fingers gently brushing her hair. Tears blurred his\\nvision as he stood, but his voice was iced iron. “For what else you have done, there can be no\\nforgiveness, Betrayer, but for Ilyena’s death I will destroy you beyond anything your master can\\nrepair. Prepare to—”\\n“Remember, you fool! Remember your futile attack on the Great Lord of the Dark! Remember his\\ncounterstroke! Remember! Even now the Hundred Companions are tearing the world apart, and every\\nday a hundred men more join them. What hand slew Ilyena Sunhair, Kinslayer? Not mine. Not mine.\\nWhat hand struck down every life that bore a drop of your blood, everyone who loved you, everyone\\nyou loved? Not mine, Kinslayer. Not mine. Remember, and know the price of opposing Shai’tan!”\\nSudden sweat made tracks down Lews Therin’s face through the dust and dirt. He remembered,\\na cloudy memory like a dream of a dream, but he knew it true.\\nHis howl beat at the walls, the howl of a man who had discovered his soul damned by his own\\nhand, and he clawed at his face as if to tear away the sight of what he had done. Everywhere he\\nlooked his eyes found the dead. Torn they were, or broken or burned, or half-consumed by stone.\\nEverywhere lay lifeless faces he knew, faces he loved. Old servants and friends of his childhood,\\nfaithful companions through the long years of battle. And his children. His own sons and daughters,\\nsprawled like broken dolls, play stilled forever. All slain by his hand. His children’s faces accused\\nhim, blank eyes asking why, and his tears were no answer. The Betrayer’s laughter flogged him,\\ndrowned out his howls. He could not bear the faces, the pain. He could not bear to remain any longer.\\nDesperately he reached out to the True Source, to tainted \\nsaidin,\\n and he Traveled.\\nThe land around him was flat and empty. A river flowed nearby, straight and broad, but he could\\nsense there were no people within a hundred leagues.

In\\none Age, called the Third Age by some, an Age yet to come, an Age long past, a wind rose in the\\nMountains of Mist. The wind was not the beginning. There are neither beginnings nor endings to the\\nturning of the Wheel of Time. But it was \\na\\n beginning.\\nBorn below the ever cloud-capped peaks that gave the mountains their name, the wind blew east,\\nout across the Sand Hills, once the shore of a great ocean, before the Breaking of the World. Down it\\nflailed into the Two Rivers, into the tangled forest called the Westwood, and beat at two men walking\\nwith a cart and horse down the rock-strewn track called the Quarry Road. For all that spring should\\nhave come a good month since, the wind carried an icy chill as if it would rather bear snow.\\nGusts plastered Rand al’Thor’s cloak to his back, whipped the earth-colored wool around his\\nlegs, then streamed it out behind him. He wished his coat were heavier, or that he had worn an extra\\nshirt. Half the time when he tried to tug the cloak back around him it caught on the quiver swinging at\\nhis hip. Trying to hold the cloak one-handed did not do much good anyway; he had his bow in the\\nother, an arrow nocked and ready to draw.\\nAs a particularly strong blast tugged the cloak out of his hand, he glanced at his father over the\\nback of the shaggy brown mare. He felt a little foolish about wanting to reassure himself that Tam was\\nstill there, but it was that kind of day. The wind howled when it rose, but aside from that, quiet lay\\nheavy on the land. The soft creak of the axle sounded loud by comparison. No birds sang in the forest,\\nno squirrels chittered from a branch. Not that he expected them, really; not this spring.\\nOnly trees that kept leaf or needle through the winter had any green about them. Snarls of last\\nyear’s bramble spread brown webs over stone outcrops under the trees. Nettles numbered most\\namong the few weeds; the rest were the sorts with sharp burrs or thorns, or stinkweed, which left a\\nrank smell on the unwary boot that crushed it. Scattered white patches of snow still dotted the ground\\nwhere tight clumps of trees kept deep shade. Where sunlight did reach, it held neither strength nor\\nwarmth. The pale sun sat above the trees to the east, but its light was crisply dark, as if mixed with\\nshadow. It was an awkward morning, made for unpleasant thoughts.\\nWithout thinking he touched the nock of the arrow; it was ready to draw to his cheek in one\\nsmooth movement, the way Tam had taught him. Winter had been bad enough on the farms, worse than\\neven the oldest folk remembered, but it must have been harsher still in the mountains, if the number of\\nwolves driven down into the Two Rivers was any guide. Wolves raided the sheep pens and chewed\\ntheir way into barns to get the cattle and horses. Bears had been after the sheep, too, where a bear had\\nnot been seen in years. It was no longer safe to be out after dark. Men were the prey as often as sheep,\\nand the sun did not always have to be down.'),\n",

Now and again he touched the mare’s\\nflank lightly, to remind her to keep moving. With his thick chest and broad face, he was a pillar of\\nreality in that morning, like a stone in the middle of a drifting dream. His sun-roughened cheeks might\\nbe lined and his hair have only a sprinkling of black among the gray, but there was a solidness to him,\\nas though a flood could wash around him without uprooting his feet. He stumped down the road now\\nimpassively. Wolves and bears were all very well, his manner said, things that any man who kept\\nsheep must be aware of, but they had best not try to stop Tam al’Thor getting to Emond’s Field.\\nWith a guilty start Rand returned to watching his side of the road, Tam’s matter-of-factness\\nreminding him of his task. He was a head taller than his father, taller than anyone else in the district,\\nand had little of Tam in him physically, except perhaps for a breadth of shoulder. Gray eyes and the\\nreddish tinge to his hair came from his mother, so Tam said. She had been an outlander, and Rand\\nremembered little of her aside from a smiling face, though he did put flowers on her grave every year,\\nat Bel Tine, in the spring, and at Sunday, in the summer.\\nTwo small casks of Tam’s apple brandy rested in the lurching cart, and eight larger barrels of\\napple cider, only slightly hard after a winter’s curing. Tam delivered the same every year to the\\nWinespring Inn for use during Bel Tine, and he had declared that it would take more than wolves or a\\ncold wind to stop him this spring. Even so they had not been to the village for weeks. Not even Tam\\ntraveled much these days. But Tam had given his word about the brandy and cider, even if he had\\nwaited to make delivery until the day before Festival. Keeping his word was important to Tam. Rand\\nwas just glad to get away from the farm, almost as glad as about the coming of Bel Tine.\\nAs Rand watched his side of the road, the feeling grew in him that he was being watched. For a\\nwhile he tried to shrug it off. Nothing moved or made a sound among the trees, except the wind. But\\nthe feeling not only persisted, it grew stronger. The hairs on his arms stirred; his skin prickled as if it\\nitched on the inside.\\nHe shifted his bow irritably to rub at his arms, and told himself to stop letting fancies take him.\\nThere was nothing in the woods on his side of the road, and Tam would have spoken if there had been\\nanything on the other. He glanced over his shoulder . . . and blinked. Not more than twenty spans back\\ndown the road a cloaked figure on horseback followed them, horse and rider alike black, dull and\\nungleaming.\\nIt was more habit than anything else that kept him walking backward alongside the cart even\\nwhile he looked.\\nThe rider’s cloak covered him to his boot tops, the cowl tugged well forward so no part of him\\nshowed. Vaguely Rand thought there was something odd about the horseman, but it was the shadowed\\nopening of the hood that fascinated him. He could see only the vaguest outlines of a face, but he had\\nthe feeling he was looking right into the rider’s eyes. And he could not look away. Queasiness settled\\nin his stomach. There was only shadow to see in the hood, but he felt hatred as sharply as if he could\\nsee a snarling face, hatred for everything that lived. Hatred for him most of all, for him above all\\nthings.\\nAbruptly a stone caught his heel and he stumbled, breaking his eyes away from the dark\\nhorseman. His bow dropped to the road, and only an outthrust hand grabbing Bela’s harness saved\\nhim from falling flat on his back. With a startled snort the mare stopped, twisting her head to see what\\nhad caught her.\\nTam frowned over Bela’s back at him. “Are you all right, lad?”\\n“A rider,” Rand said breathlessly, pulling himself upright. “A stranger, following us.”'),\n",

The road behind was\\nempty. Disbelieving, he stared into the forest on both sides of the road. Bare-branched trees offered\\nno hiding place, but there was not a glimmer of horse or horseman. He met his father’s questioning\\ngaze. “He was there. A man in a black cloak, on a black horse.”\\n“I wouldn’t doubt your word, lad, but where has he gone?”\\n“I don’t know. But he was there.” He snatched up the fallen bow and arrow, hastily checked the\\nfletching before renocking, and half drew before letting the bowstring relax. There was nothing to aim\\nat. “He was.”\\nTam shook his grizzled head. “If you say so, lad. Come on, then. A horse leaves hoofprints, even\\non this ground.” He started toward the rear of the cart, his cloak whipping in the wind. “If we find\\nthem, we’ll know for a fact he was there. If not . . . well, these are days to make a man think he’s\\nseeing things.”\\nAbruptly Rand realized what had been odd about the horseman, aside from his being there at all.\\nThe wind that beat at Tam and him had not so much as shifted a fold of that black cloak. His mouth\\nwas suddenly dry. He must have imagined it. His father was right; this was a morning to prickle a\\nman’s imagination. But he did not believe it. Only, how did he tell his father that the man who had\\napparently vanished into air wore a cloak the wind did not touch?\\nWith a worried frown he peered into the woods around them; it looked different than it ever had\\nbefore. Almost since he was old enough to walk, he had run loose in the forest. The ponds and\\nstreams of the Waterwood, beyond the last farms east of Emond’s Field, were where he had learned\\nto swim. He had explored into the Sand Hills—which many in the Two Rivers said was bad luck—\\nand once he had even gone to the very foot of the Mountains of Mist, him and his closest friends, Mat\\nCauthon and Perrin Aybara. That was a lot further afield than most people in Emond’s Field ever\\nwent; to them a journey to the next village, up to Watch Hill or down to Deven Ride, was a big event.\\nNowhere in all of that had he found a place that made him afraid. Today, though, the Westwood was\\nnot the place he remembered. A man who could disappear so suddenly could reappear just as\\nsuddenly, maybe even right beside them.\\n“No, father, there’s no need.” When Tam stopped in surprise, Rand covered his flush by tugging\\nat the hood of his cloak. “You’re probably right. No point looking for what isn’t there, not when we\\ncan use the time getting on to the village and out of this wind.”\\n“I could do with a pipe,” Tam said slowly, “and a mug of ale where it’s warm.” Abruptly he\\ngave a broad grin. “And I expect you’re eager to see Egwene.”\\nRand managed a weak smile. Of all things he might want to think about right then, the Mayor’s\\ndaughter was far down the list. He did not need any more confusion. For the past year she had been\\nmaking him increasingly jittery whenever they were together. Worse, she did not even seem to be\\naware of it. No, he certainly did not want to add Egwene to his thoughts.\\nHe was hoping his father had not noticed he was afraid when Tam said, “Remember the flame,\\nlad, and the void.”\\nIt was an odd thing Tam had taught him. Concentrate on a single flame and feed all your passions\\ninto it—fear, hate, anger—until your mind became empty. Become one with the void, Tam said, and\\nyou could do anything. Nobody else in Emond’s Field talked that way. But Tam won the archery\\ncompetition at Bel Tine every year with his flame and his void. Rand thought he might have a chance\\nat placing this year himself, if he could manage to hold onto the void. For Tam to bring it up now\\nmeant he \\nhad\\n noticed, but he said nothing more about it.'),\n",

There \\nhad\\n been someone. And that someone had\\nmeant him harm. He did not stop looking back until the high-peaked, thatched roofs of Emond’s Field\\nsurrounded him.\\nThe village lay close onto the Westwood, the forest gradually thinning until the last few trees\\nstood actually among the stout frame houses. The land sloped gently down to the east. Though not\\nwithout patches of woods, farms and hedge-bordered fields and pastures quilted the land beyond the\\nvillage all the way to the Waterwood and its tangle of streams and ponds. The land to the west was\\njust as fertile, and the pastures there lush in most years, but only a handful of farms could be found in\\nthe Westwood. Even those few dwindled to none miles short of the Sand Hills, not to mention the\\nMountains of Mist, which rose above the Westwood treetops, distant but in plain sight from Emond’s\\nField. Some said the land was too rocky, as if there were not rocks everywhere in the Two Rivers,\\nand others said it was hard-luck land. A few muttered that there was no point getting any closer to the\\nmountains than needs be. Whatever the reasons, only the hardiest men farmed in the Westwood.\\nSmall children and dogs dodged around the cart in whooping swarms once it passed the first\\nrow of houses. Bela plodded on patiently, ignoring the yelling youngsters who tumbled under her\\nnose, playing tag and rolling hoops. In the last months there had been little of play or laughter from the\\nchildren; even when the weather had slackened enough to let children out, fear of wolves kept them\\nin. It seemed the approach of Bel Tine had taught them how to play again.\\nFestival had affected the adults as well. Broad shutters were thrown back, and in almost every\\nhouse the goodwife stood in a window, apron tied about her and long-braided hair done up in a\\nkerchief, shaking sheets or hanging mattresses over the windowsills. Whether or not leaves had\\nappeared on the trees, no woman would let Bel Tine come before her spring cleaning was done. In\\nevery yard rugs hung from stretched lines, and children who had not been quick enough to run free in\\nthe streets instead vented their frustration on the carpets with wicker beaters. On roof after roof the\\ngoodman of the house clambered about, checking the thatch to see if the winter’s damage meant\\ncalling on old Cenn Buie, the thatcher.\\nSeveral times Tam paused to engage one man or another in brief conversation. Since he and\\nRand had not been off the farm for weeks, everyone wanted to catch up on how things were out that\\nway. Few Westwood men had been in. Tam spoke of damage from winter storms, each one worse\\nthan the one before, and stillborn lambs, of brown fields where crops should be sprouting and\\npastures greening, of ravens flocking in where songbirds had come in years before. Grim talk, with\\npreparations for Bel Tine going on all around them, and much shaking of heads. It was the same on all\\nsides.\\nMost of the men rolled their shoulders and said, “Well, we’ll survive, the Light willing.” Some\\ngrinned and added, “And if the Light doesn’t will, we’ll still survive.”\\nThat was the way of most Two Rivers people. People who had to watch the hail beat their crops\\nor the wolves take their lambs, and start over, no matter how many years it happened, did not give up\\neasily.

He had been sprawled on his front\\nsteps, not up on his roof, though the thatch looked as if it badly needed Master Buie’s attention. He\\nnever seemed ready to start over, or to finish what he started the first time. Most of the Coplins and\\nCongars were like that, those who were not worse.\\n“What are we going to do about Nynaeve, al’Thor?” Congar demanded. “We can’t have a\\nWisdom like that for Emond’s Field.”\\nTam sighed heavily. “It’s not our place, Wit. The Wisdom is women’s business.”\\n“Well, we’d better do something, al’Thor. She said we’d have a mild winter. And a good\\nharvest. Now you ask her what she hears on the wind, and she just scowls at you and stomps off.”\\n“If you asked her the way you usually do, Wit,” Tam said patiently, “you’re lucky she didn’t\\nthump you with that stick she carries. Now if you don’t mind, this brandy—”\\n“Nynaeve al’Meara is just too young to be Wisdom, al’Thor. If the Women’s Circle won’t do\\nsomething, then the Village Council has to.”\\n“What business of yours is the Wisdom, Wit Congar?” roared a woman’s voice. Wit flinched as\\nhis wife marched out of the house. Daise Congar was twice as wide as Wit, a hard-faced woman\\nwithout an ounce of fat on her. She glared at him with her fists on her hips. “You try meddling in\\nWomen’s Circle business, and see how you like eating your own cooking. Which you won’t do in my\\nkitchen. And washing your own clothes and making your own bed. Which won’t be under my roof.”\\n“But, Daise,” Wit whined, “I was just. . . .”\\n“If you’ll pardon me, Daise,” Tam said. “Wit. The Light shine on you both.” He got Bela moving\\nagain, leading her around the scrawny fellow. Daise was concentrating on her husband now, but any\\nminute she could realize whom it was Wit had been talking to.\\nThat was why they had not accepted any of the invitations to stop for a bite to eat or something\\nhot to drink. When they saw Tam, the goodwives of Emond’s Field went on point like hounds spotting\\na rabbit. There was not a one of them who did not know just the perfect wife for a widower with a\\ngood farm, even if it was in the Westwood.\\nRand stepped along just as quickly as Tam, perhaps even more so. He was sometimes cornered\\nwhen Tam was not around, with no way to escape outside of rudeness. Herded onto a stool by the\\nkitchen fire, he would be fed pastries or honeycakes or meatpies. And always the goodwife’s eyes\\nweighed and measured him as neatly as any merchant’s scales and tapes while she told him that what\\nhe was eating was not nearly so good as her widowed sister’s cooking, or her next-to-eldest cousin’s.\\nTam was certainly not getting any younger, she would say. It was good that he had loved his wife so\\n—it boded well for the next woman in his life—but he had mourned long enough. Tam needed a good\\nwoman. It was a simple fact, she would say, or something very close, that a man just could not do\\nwithout a woman to take care of him and keep him out of trouble. Worst of all were those who paused\\nthoughtfully at about that point, then asked with elaborate casualness exactly how old \\nhe\\n was now.\\nLike most Two Rivers folk, Rand had a strong stubborn streak. Outsiders sometimes said it was\\nthe prime trait of people in the Two Rivers, that they could give mules lessons and teach stones. The\\ngoodwives were fine and kindly women for the most part, but he hated being pushed into anything,\\nand they made him feel as if he were being prodded with sticks. So he walked fast, and wished Tam\\nwould hurry Bela along.\\nSoon the street opened onto the Green, a broad expanse in the middle of the village. Usually'),\n",

A double handful of geese waddled about, beadily\\neyeing the ground but not finding anything worth pecking, and someone had tethered a milkcow to\\ncrop the sparse growth.\\nToward the west end of the Green, the Winespring itself gushed out of a low stone outcrop in a\\nflow that never failed, a flow strong enough to knock a man down and sweet enough to justify its name\\na dozen times over. From the spring the rapidly widening Winespring Water ran swiftly off to the\\neast, willows dotting its banks all the way to Master Thane’s mill and beyond, until it split into\\ndozens of streams in the swampy depths of the Waterwood. Two low, railed footbridges crossed the\\nclear stream at the Green, and one bridge wider than the others and stout enough to bear wagons. The\\nWagon Bridge marked where the North Road, coming down from Taren Ferry and Watch Hill,\\nbecame the Old Road, leading to Deven Ride. Outsiders sometimes found it funny that the road had\\none name to the north and another to the south, but that was the way it had always been, as far as\\nanyone in Emond’s Field knew, and that was that. It was a good enough reason for Two Rivers\\npeople.\\nOn the far side of the bridges, the mounds were already building for the Bel Tine fires, three\\ncareful stacks of logs almost as big as houses. They had to be on cleared dirt, of course, not on the\\nGreen, even sparse as it was.

Shorn\\nof its branches, the straight, slender trunk of a fir tree stood ten feet high even in the hole they had dug\\nfor it. A knot of girls too young to wear their hair braided sat cross-legged and watched enviously,\\noccasionally singing snatches of the song the women sang.\\nTam clucked at Bela as if to make her speed her pace, though she ignored it, and Rand studiously\\nkept his eyes from what the women were doing. In the morning the men would pretend to be surprised\\nto find the Pole, then at noon the unmarried women would dance the Pole, entwining it with long,\\ncolored ribbons while the unmarried men sang. No one knew when the custom began or why—it was\\nanother thing that was the way it had always been—but it was an excuse to sing and dance, and\\nnobody in the Two Rivers needed much excuse for that.\\nThe whole day of Bel Tine would be taken up with singing and dancing and feasting, with time\\nout for footraces, and contests in almost everything. Prizes would be given not only in archery, but for\\nthe best with the sling, and the quarterstaff. There would be contests at solving riddles and puzzles, at\\nthe rope tug, and lifting and tossing weights, prizes for the best singer, the best dancer and the best\\nfiddle player, for the quickest to shear a sheep, even the best at bowls, and at darts.\\nBel Tine was supposed to come when spring had well and truly arrived, the first lambs born and\\nthe first crop up. Even with the cold hanging on, though, no one had any idea of putting it off.\\nEveryone could use a little singing and dancing. And to top everything, if the rumors could be\\nbelieved, a grand display of fireworks was planned for the Green—if the first peddler of the year\\nappeared in time, of course. That had been causing considerable talk; it was ten years since the last\\nsuch display, and that was still talked about.\\nThe Winespring Inn stood at the east end of the Green, hard beside the Wagon Bridge. The first\\nfloor of the inn was river rock, though the foundation was of older stone some said came from the\\nmountains.

A huge oak grew in the middle of it now, with a\\nbole thirty paces around and spreading branches as thick as a man. In the summer, Bran al’Vere set\\ntables and benches under those branches, shady with leaves then, where people could enjoy a cup and\\na cooling breeze while they talked or perhaps set out a board for a game of stones.\\n“Here we are, lad.” Tam reached for Bela’s harness, but she stopped in front of the inn before\\nhis hand touched leather. “Knows the way better than I do,” he chuckled.\\nAs the last creak of the axle faded, Bran al’Vere appeared from the inn, seeming as always to\\nstep too lightly for a man of his girth, nearly double that of anyone else in the village.

And the weather.”\\nBran harrumphed. “I could wish somebody wanted to talk about something besides the weather.\\nEveryone complains about it, and folk who should know better expect me to set it right. I’ve just spent\\ntwenty minutes explaining to Mistress al’Donel that I can do nothing about the storks. Though what\\nshe expected me to do. . . .” He shook his head.\\n“An ill omen,” a scratchy voice announced, “no storks nesting on the rooftops at Bel Tine.” Cenn\\nBuie, as gnarled and dark as an old root, marched up to Tam and Bran and leaned on his walking\\nstaff, near as tall as he was and just as gnarled. He tried to fix both men at once with a beady eye.\\n“There’s worse to come, you mark my words.”\\n“Have you become a soothsayer, then, interpreting omens?” Tam asked dryly. “Or do you listen\\nto the wind, like a Wisdom? There’s certainly enough of it. Some originating not far from here.”\\n“Mock if you will,” Cenn muttered, “but if it doesn’t warm enough for crops to sprout soon,\\nmore than one root cellar will come up empty before there’s a harvest. By next winter there may be\\nnothing left alive in the Two Rivers but wolves and ravens. If it is next winter at all. Maybe it will\\nstill be this winter.”\\n“Now what is that supposed to mean?” Bran said sharply.\\nCenn gave them a sour look. “I’ve not much good to say about Nynaeve al’Meara. You know\\nthat. For one thing, she’s too young to—No matter. The Women’s Circle seems to object to the'),\n",

We have enough problems without. . . .”\\nA quick tug at Rand’s sleeve and a voice pitched low, for his ear alone, distracted him from the\\nolder men’s talk. “Come on, Rand, while they’re arguing. Before they put you to work.”\\nRand glanced down, and had to grin. Mat Cauthon crouched beside the cart so Tam and Bran and\\nCenn could not see him, his wiry body contorted like a stork trying to bend itself double.\\nMat’s brown eyes twinkled with mischief, as usual. “Dav and I caught a big old badger, all\\ngrouchy at being pulled out of his den. We’re going to let it loose on the Green and watch the girls\\nrun.”\\nRand’s smile broadened; it did not sound as much like fun to him as it would have a year or two\\nback, but Mat never seemed to grow up. He took a quick look at his father—the men had their heads\\ntogether still, all three talking at once—then lowered his own voice. “I promised to unload the cider.\\nI can meet you later, though.”\\nMat rolled his eyes skyward. “Toting barrels! Burn me, I’d rather play stones with my baby\\nsister. Well, I know of better things than a badger. We have strangers in the Two Rivers. Last evening\\n—”\\nFor an instant Rand stopped breathing. “A man on horseback?” he asked intently. “A man in a\\nblack cloak, on a black horse? And his cloak doesn’t move in the wind?”\\nMat swallowed his grin, and his voice dropped to an even hoarser whisper. “You saw him, too?\\nI thought I was the only one. Don’t laugh, Rand, but he scared me.”\\n“I’m not laughing. He scared me, too. I could swear he hated me, that he wanted to kill me.”\\nRand shivered. Until that day he had never thought of anyone wanting to kill him, really wanting to\\nkill him. That sort of thing just did not happen in the Two Rivers. A fistfight, maybe, or a wrestling\\nmatch, but not killing.\\n“I don’t know about hating, Rand, but he was scary enough anyway. All he did was sit on his\\nhorse looking at me, just outside the village, but I’ve never been so frightened in my life. Well, I\\nlooked away, just for a moment—it wasn’t easy, mind you—then when I looked back he’d vanished.\\nBlood and ashes! Three days, it’s been, and I can hardly stop thinking about him. I keep looking over\\nmy shoulder.” Mat attempted a laugh that came out as a croak. “Funny how being scared takes you.\\nYou think strange things. I actually thought—just for a minute, mind—it might be the Dark One.” He\\ntried another laugh, but no sound at all came out this time.\\nRand took a deep breath. As much to remind himself as for any other reason, he said by rote,\\n“The Dark One and all of the Forsaken are bound in Shayol Ghul, beyond the Great Blight, bound by\\nthe Creator at the moment of Creation, bound until the end of time. The hand of the Creator shelters\\nthe world, and the Light shines on us all.” He drew another breath and went on. “Besides, if he was\\nfree, what would the Shepherd of the Night be doing in the Two Rivers watching farmboys?”\\n“I don’t know. But I do know that rider was . . . evil. Don’t laugh. I’ll take oath on it. Maybe it'),\n",

If I ever\\nsaw anybody who looked like Ishamael, or Aginor, it was him.”\\n“Everybody’s mother scared them with the Forsaken,” Rand said dryly, “but most grow out of it.\\nWhy not the Shadowman, while you’re about it?”\\nMat glared at him. “I haven’t been so scared since. . . . No, I’ve never been that scared, and I\\ndon’t mind admitting it.”\\n“Me, either. My father thinks I was jumping at shadows under the trees.”\\nMat nodded glumly and leaned back against the cart wheel. “So does my da. I told Dav, and\\nElam Dowtry. They’ve been watching like hawks ever since, but they haven’t seen anything. Now\\nElam thinks I was trying to trick him. Dav thinks he’s down from Taren Ferry—a sheepstealer, or a\\nchickenthief. A chickenthief!” He lapsed into affronted silence.\\n“It’s probably all foolishness anyway,” Rand said finally. “Maybe he is just a sheepstealer.” He\\ntried to picture it, but it was like picturing a wolf taking the cat’s place in front of a mouse hole.\\n“Well, I didn’t like the way he looked at me. And neither did you, not if how you jumped at me\\nis any guide. We ought to tell someone.”\\n“We already have, Mat, both of us, and we weren’t believed. Can you imagine trying to\\nconvince Master al’Vere about this fellow, without him seeing him? He’d send us off to Nynaeve to\\nsee if we were sick.”\\n“There are two of us, now. Nobody could believe we both imagined it.”\\nRand rubbed the top of his head briskly, wondering what to say. Mat was something of a byword\\naround the village. Few people had escaped his pranks. Now his name came up whenever a washline\\ndropped the laundry in the dirt or a loose saddle girth deposited a farmer in the road. Mat did not\\neven have to be anywhere around. His support might be worse than none.\\nAfter a moment Rand said, “Your father would believe you put me up to it, and mine. . . .” He\\nlooked over the cart to where Tam and Bran and Cenn had been talking, and found himself staring his\\nfather in the eyes. The Mayor was still lecturing Cenn, who took it now in sullen silence.\\n“Good morning, Matrim,” Tam said brightly, hefting one of the brandy casks up onto the side of\\nthe cart. “I see you’ve come to help Rand unload the cider. Good lad.”\\nMat leaped to his feet at the first word and began backing away. “Good morning to you, Master\\nal’Thor. And to you, Master al’Vere. Master Buie. May the Light shine on you. My da sent me to—”\\n“No doubt he did,” Tam said. “And no doubt, since you are a lad who does his chores right off,\\nyou’ve finished the task already. Well, the quicker you lads get the cider into Master al’Vere’s cellar,\\nthe quicker you can see the gleeman.”\\n“Gleeman!” Mat exclaimed, stopping dead in his footsteps, at the same instant that Rand asked,\\n“When will he get here?”\\nRand could remember only two gleemen coming into the Two Rivers in his whole life, and for\\none of those he had been young enough to sit on Tam’s shoulders to watch. To have one there actually\\nduring Bel Tine, with his harp and his flute and his stories and all. . . . Emond’s Field would still be\\ntalking about this Festival ten years off, even if there were not any fireworks.\\n“Foolishness,” Cenn grumbled, but fell silent at a look from Bran that had all the weight of the\\nMayor’s office in it.\\nTam leaned against the side of the cart, using the brandy cask as a prop for his arm. “Yes, a'),\n",

According to Master al’Vere, he’s in a room in the inn right now.”\\n“Arrived in the dead of night, he did.” The innkeeper shook his head in disapproval. “Pounded\\non the front door till he woke the whole family. If not for Festival, I’d have told him to stable his own\\nhorse and sleep in the stall with it, gleeman or not. Imagine coming in the dark like that.”\\nRand stared wonderingly. No one traveled beyond the village by night, not these days, certainly\\nnot alone. The thatcher grumbled under his breath again, too low this time for Rand to understand\\nmore than a word or two. “Madman” and “unnatural.”\\n“He doesn’t wear a black cloak, does he?” Mat asked suddenly.\\nBran’s belly shook with his chuckle. “Black! His cloak is like every gleeman’s cloak I’ve ever\\nseen. More patches than cloak, and more colors than you can think of.”\\nRand startled himself by laughing out loud, a laugh of pure relief. The menacing black-clad rider\\nas a gleeman was a ridiculous notion, but. . . . He clapped a hand over his mouth in embarrassment.\\n“You see, Tam,” Bran said. “There’s been little enough laughter in this village since winter\\ncame. Now even the gleeman’s cloak brings a laugh. That alone is worth the expense of bringing him\\ndown from Baerlon.”\\n“Say what you will,” Cenn spoke up suddenly. “I still say it’s a foolish waste of money. And\\nthose fireworks you all insisted on sending off for.”\\n“So there are fireworks,” Mat said, but Cenn went right on.\\n“They should have been here a month ago with the first peddler of the year, but there hasn’t been\\na peddler, has there? If he doesn’t come by tomorrow, what are we going to do with them? Hold\\nanother Festival just to set them off? That’s if he even brings them, of course.”\\n“Cenn”—Tam sighed—“you’ve as much trust as a Taren Ferry man.”\\n“Where is he, then? Tell me that, al’Thor.”\\n“Why didn’t you tell us?” Mat demanded in an aggrieved voice. “The whole village would have\\nhad as much fun with the waiting as with the gleeman. Or almost, anyway. You can see how\\neverybody’s been over just a rumor of fireworks.”\\n“I can see,” Bran replied with a sidelong look at the thatcher. “And if I knew for sure how that\\nrumor started . . . if I thought, for instance, that somebody had been complaining about how much\\nthings cost where people could hear him when the things are supposed to be secret. . . .”\\nCenn cleared his throat. “My bones are too old for this wind. If you don’t mind, I’ll just see if\\nMistress al’Vere won’t fix me some mulled wine to take the chill off. Mayor. Al’Thor.” He was\\nheaded for the inn before he finished, and as the door swung shut behind him, Bran sighed.\\n“Sometimes I think Nynaeve is right about. . . . Well, that’s not important now. You young\\nfellows think for a minute. Everyone’s excited about the fireworks, true, and that’s only at a rumor.\\nThink how they’ll be if the peddler doesn’t get here in time, after all their anticipating. And with the\\nweather the way it is, who knows when he will come. They’d be fifty times as excited about a\\ngleeman.”\\n“And feel fifty times as bad if he hadn’t come,” Rand said slowly. “Even Bel Tine might not do\\nmuch for people’s spirits after that.”\\n“You have a head on your shoulders when you choose to use it,” Bran said. “He’ll follow you on\\nthe Village Council one day, Tam. Mark my words. He couldn’t do much worse right now than\\nsomeone I could name.”\\n“None of this is unloading the cart,” Tam said briskly, handing the first cask of brandy to the\\nMayor. “I want a warm fire, my pipe, and a mug of your good ale.” He hoisted the second brandy\\ncask onto his shoulder. “I’m sure Rand will thank you for your help, Matrim.

Scratch, the inn’s yellow cat, crouched atop it with his eyes closed and his tail\\nwrapped around his feet. Tam stood in front of the big fireplace of river rock, thumbing a long-\\nstemmed pipe full of tabac from a polished canister the innkeeper always kept on the plain stone\\nmantel. The fireplace stretched half the length of the big, square room, with a lintel as high as a man’s\\nshoulder, and the crackling blaze on the hearth vanquished the chill outside.\\nAt that time of the busy day before Festival, Rand expected to find the common room empty\\nexcept for Bran and his father and the cat, but four more members of the Village Council, including\\nCenn, sat in high-backed chairs in front of the fire, mugs in hand and blue-gray pipesmoke wreathing\\ntheir heads. For once none of the stones boards were in use, and all of Bran’s books stood idle on the\\nshelf opposite the fireplace. The men did not even talk, peering silently into their ale or tapping\\npipestems against their teeth in impatience, as they waited for Tam and Bran to join them.\\nWorry was not uncommon for the Village Council these days, not in Emond’s Field, and likely\\nnot in Watch Hill, or Deven Ride. Or even Taren Ferry, though who knew what Taren Ferry folk\\nreally thought about anything?\\nOnly two of the men before the fire, Haral Luhhan, the blacksmith, and Jon Thane, the miller, so\\nmuch as glanced at the boys as they entered. Master Luhhan, though, made it more than a glance. The\\nblacksmith’s arms were as big as most men’s legs, roped with heavy muscle, and he still wore his\\nlong leather apron as if he had hurried to the meeting straight from the forge. His frown took them both\\nin, then he straightened around in his chair deliberately, turning his attention back to an over-studious\\ntamping of his pipe with a thick thumb.\\nCurious, Rand slowed, then barely bit back a yelp as Mat kicked his ankle. His friend nodded\\ninsistently toward the doorway at the back of the common room and hurried on without waiting.\\nLimping slightly, Rand followed less quickly.\\n“What was that about?” he demanded as soon as he was in the hall that led to the kitchen. “You\\nalmost broke my—”\\n“It’s old Luhhan,” Mat said, peering past Rand’s shoulder into the common room. “I think he\\nsuspects I was the one who—” He cut off abruptly as Mistress al’Vere bustled out of the kitchen, the\\naroma of fresh-baked bread wafting ahead of her.\\nThe tray in her hands carried some of the crusty loaves for which she was famous around\\nEmond’s Field, as well as plates of pickles and cheese. The food reminded Rand abruptly that he had\\neaten only an end of bread before leaving the farm that morning. His stomach gave an embarrassing\\nrumble.'),\n",

Or any other age, for that matter. If\\nyou prefer, I’m baking honeycakes this morning.”\\nShe was one of the few married women in the area who never tried to play matchmaker with\\nTam. Toward Rand her motherliness extended to warm smiles and a quick snack whenever he came\\nby the inn, but she did as much for every young man in the area. If she occasionally looked at him as if\\nshe wanted to do more, at least she took it no further than looks, for which he was deeply grateful.\\nWithout waiting for a reply she swept on into the common room. Immediately there was the\\nsound of chairs scraping on the floor as the men got to their feet, and exclaimings over the smell of the\\nbread. She was easily the best cook in Emond’s Field, and not a man for miles around but eagerly\\nleaped at a chance to put his feet under her table.\\n“Honeycakes,” Mat said, smacking his lips.\\n“After,” Rand told him firmly, “or we’ll never get done.”\\nA lamp hung over the cellar stairs, just beside the kitchen door, and another made a bright pool\\nin the stone-walled room beneath the inn, banishing all but a little dimness in the furthest corners.\\nWooden racks along the walls and across the floor held casks of brandy and cider, and larger barrels\\nof ale and wine, some with taps driven in. Many of the wine barrels were marked with chalk in Bran\\nal’Vere’s hand, giving the year they had been bought, what peddler had brought them, and in which\\ncity they had been made, but all of the ale and brandy was the make of Two Rivers farmers or of Bran\\nhimself. Peddlers, and even merchants, sometimes brought brandy or ale from outside, but it was\\nnever as good and cost the earth, besides, and nobody ever drank it more than once.\\n“Now,” Rand said, as they set their casks in the racks, “what did you do that you have to avoid\\nMaster Luhhan?”\\nMat shrugged. “Nothing, really. I told Adan al’Caar and some of his snot-nosed friends—Ewin\\nFinngar and Dag Coplin—that some farmers had seen ghost hounds, breathing fire and running through\\nthe woods. They ate it up like clotted cream.”\\n“And Master Luhhan is mad at you for that?” Rand said doubtfully.\\n“Not exactly.” Mat paused, then shook his head. “You see, I covered two of his dogs with flour,\\nso they were all white. Then I let them loose near Dag’s house. How was I to know they’d run straight\\nhome? It really isn’t my fault. If Mistress Luhhan hadn’t left the door open they couldn’t have gotten\\ninside. It isn’t like I intended to get flour all over her house.” He gave a bark of laughter. “I hear she\\nchased old Luhhan and the dogs, all three, out of the house with a broom.”\\nRand winced and laughed at the same time. “If I were you, I’d worry more about Alsbet Luhhan\\nthan about the blacksmith. She’s almost as strong, and her temper is a lot worse. No matter, though. If\\nyou walk fast, maybe he won’t notice you.” Mat’s expression said he did not think Rand was funny.\\nWhen they went back through the common room, though, there was no need for Mat to hurry. The\\nsix men had their chairs in a tight knot before the fireplace. With his back to the fire, Tam was\\nspeaking in a low voice, and the others were leaning forward to listen, so intent on his words they\\nwould likely not have noticed if a flock of sheep had been driven through.

Could you see his face?”\\nEwin looked uncertainly from one of them to the other, then spoke quickly when Mat took a\\nthreatening step. “Of course I could see his face. And his cloak is green. Or maybe gray. It changes. It\\nseems to fade into wherever he’s standing. Sometimes you don’t see him even when you look right at\\nhim, not unless he moves.

I saw them ride in. Their horses, Rand. I never saw horses\\nso tall, or so sleek. They look like they could run forever. I think he works for her.”\\n“In service,” Ewin broke in. “They call it being in service, in the stories.”\\nMat continued as if Ewin had not spoken. “Anyway, he defers to her, does what she says. Only\\nhe isn’t like a hired man. A soldier, maybe. The way he wears his sword, it’s part of him, like his\\nhand or his foot. He makes the merchants’ guards look like cur dogs. And her, Rand.

Like a high-born lady,” he finished with a sigh.\\n“But who are they?” Rand asked. Except for merchants, once a year to buy tabac and wool, and\\nthe peddlers, outsiders never came into the Two Rivers, or as good as never. Maybe at Taren Ferry,\\nbut not this far south. Most of the merchants and peddlers had been coming for years, too, so they did\\nnot really count as strangers. Just outsiders. It was a good five years since the last time a real stranger\\nappeared in Emond’s Field, and he had been trying to hide from some sort of trouble up in Baerlon\\nthat nobody in the village understood. He had not stayed long. “What do they want?”\\n“What do they want?” Mat exclaimed. “I don’t care what they want. Strangers, Rand, and\\nstrangers like you never even dreamed of. Think of it!”\\nRand opened his mouth, then closed it without speaking. The black-cloaked rider had him as\\nnervous as a cat in a dog run. It just seemed like an awful coincidence, three strangers around the\\nvillage at the same time. Three if this fellow’s cloak that changed colors never changed to black.\\n“Her name is Moiraine,” Ewin said into the momentary silence. “I heard him say it. Moiraine, he\\ncalled her. The Lady Moiraine. His name is Lan. The Wisdom may not like her, but I do.”\\n“What makes you think Nynaeve dislikes her?” Rand said.\\n“She asked the Wisdom for directions this morning,” Ewin said, “and called her ‘child.’ ” Rand'),\n",

She’s always asking questions, about\\nhow old people are, and how long they’ve lived where they live, and . . . oh, I don’t know what all.\\nAnyway, Nynaeve answered like she’d bitten a green sweetberry. Then, when the Lady Moiraine\\nwalked away, Nynaeve stared after her like, like . . . well, it wasn’t friendly, I can tell you that.”\\n“Is that all?” Rand said. “You know Nynaeve’s temper. When Cenn Buie called her a child last\\nyear, she thumped him on the head with her stick, and he’s on the Village Council, and old enough to\\nbe her grandfather, besides.

Or the frogs?”\\nRand paused long enough to turn down the lamp, then hurried after them.\\nIn the common room Rowan Hum and Samel Crawe had joined the others in front of the fire, so\\nthat the entire Village Council was there. Bran al’Vere spoke now, his normally bluff voice pitched\\nso low that only a rumbling murmur traveled beyond the close-gathered chairs.

Fluffing its wings once, it cocked its head again, fixing them with a dead black\\neye, unafraid, giving no sign that anything had happened.\\nRand stared at the bird in consternation. “Did you ever see a raven do that?” he asked quietly.\\nMat shook his head without looking away from the raven. “Never. Nor any other bird, either.”\\n“A vile bird,” came a woman’s voice from behind them, melodious despite echoes of distaste,\\n“to be mistrusted in the best of times.”\\nWith a shrill cry the raven launched itself into the air so violently that two black feathers drifted\\ndown from the roof’s edge.\\nStartled, Rand and Mat twisted to follow the bird’s swift flight, over the Green and toward the\\ncloud-tipped Mountains of Mist, tall beyond the Westwood, until it dwindled to a speck in the west,\\nthen vanished from view.\\nRand’s gaze fell to the woman who had spoken. She, too, had been watching the flight of the\\nraven, but now she turned back, and her eyes met his. He could only stare. This had to be the Lady\\nMoiraine, and she was everything that Mat and Ewin had said, everything and more.\\nWhen he had heard she called Nynaeve child, he had pictured her as old, but she was not. At\\nleast, he could not put any age to her at all. At first he thought she was as young as Nynaeve, but the\\nlonger he looked the more he thought she was older than that. There was a maturity about her large,\\ndark eyes, a hint of knowing that no one could have gotten young. For an instant he thought those eyes\\nwere deep pools about to swallow him up. It was plain why Mat and Ewin named her a lady from a\\ngleeman’s tale, too. She held herself with a grace and air of command that made him feel awkward\\nand stumble-footed. She was barely tall enough to come up to his chest, but her presence was such\\nthat her height seemed the proper one, and he felt ungainly in his tallness.\\nAltogether she was like no one he had ever seen before. The wide hood of her cloak framed her\\nface and dark hair, hanging in soft ringlets. He had never seen a grown woman with her hair\\nunbraided; every girl in the Two Rivers waited eagerly for the Women’s Circle of her village to say\\nshe was old enough to wear a braid. Her clothes were just as strange. Her cloak was sky-blue velvet,\\nwith thick silver embroidery, leaves and vines and flowers, all along the edges. Her dress gleamed\\nfaintly as she moved, a darker blue than the cloak, and slashed with cream. A necklace of heavy gold\\nlinks hung around her neck, while another gold chain, delicate and fastened in her hair, supported a\\nsmall, sparkling blue stone in the middle of her forehead. A wide belt of woven gold encircled her\\nwaist, and on the second finger of her left hand was a gold ring in the shape of a serpent biting its own\\ntail. He had certainly never seen a ring like that, though he recognized the Great Serpent, an even\\nolder symbol for eternity than the Wheel of Time.\\nFancier than any feastday clothes, Ewin had said, and he was right. No one ever dressed like that\\nin the Two Rivers. Not ever.\\n“Good morning, Mistress . . . ah . . . Lady Moiraine,” Rand said. His face grew hot at his\\ntongue’s fumbling.\\n“Good morning, Lady Moiraine,” Mat echoed somewhat more smoothly, but only a little.\\nShe smiled, and Rand found himself wondering if there was anything he might do for her,\\nsomething that would give him an excuse to stay near her. He knew she was smiling at all of them, but'),\n",

It really was just like seeing a gleeman’s tale come to life. Mat had a\\nfoolish grin on his face.\\n“You know my name,” she said, sounding delighted. As if her presence, however brief, would\\nnot be the talk of the village for a year! “But you must call me Moiraine, not lady. And what are your\\nnames?”\\nEwin leaped forward before either of the others could speak. “My name is Ewin Finngar, my\\nlady. I told them your name; that’s how they know. I heard Lan say it, but I wasn’t eavesdropping. No\\none like you has ever come to Emond’s Field, before. There’s a gleeman in the village for Bel Tine,\\ntoo. And tonight is Winternight. Will you come to my house? My mother has apple cakes.”\\n“I shall have to see,” she replied, putting a hand on Ewin’s shoulder. Her eyes twinkled with\\namusement, though she gave no other sign of it. “I do not know how well I could compete against a\\ngleeman, Ewin. But you must all call me Moiraine.” She looked expectantly at Rand and Mat.\\n“I’m Matrim Cauthon, La . . . ah . . . Moiraine,” Mat said. He made a stiff, jerking bow, then\\nwent red in the face as he straightened.\\nRand had been wondering if he should do something of the sort, the way men did in stories, but\\nwith Mat’s example, he merely spoke his name. At least he did not stumble over his own tongue this\\ntime.\\nMoiraine looked from him to Mat and back again. Rand thought her smile, a bare curve of the\\ncorners of her mouth, was now the sort Egwene wore when she had a secret. “I may have some small\\ntasks to be done from time to time while I am in Emond’s Field,” she said. “Perhaps you would be\\nwilling to assist me?” She laughed as their assents tumbled over one another. “Here,” she said, and\\nRand was surprised when she pressed a coin into his palm, closing his hand tightly around it with\\nboth of hers.\\n“There’s no need,” he began, but she waved aside his protest as she gave Ewin a coin as well,\\nthen pressed Mat’s hand around one the same way she had Rand’s.\\n“Of course, there is,” she said. “You cannot be expected to work for nothing. Consider this a\\ntoken, and keep it with you, so you will remember that you have agreed to come to me when I ask it.\\nThere is a bond between us now.”\\n“I’ll never forget,” Ewin piped up.\\n“Later we must talk,” she said, “and you must tell me all about yourselves.”\\n“Lady . . . I mean, Moiraine?” Rand asked hesitantly as she turned away. She stopped and\\nlooked back over her shoulder, and he had to swallow before going on. “Why have you come to\\nEmond’s Field?” Her expression was unchanged, but suddenly he wished he had not asked, though he\\ncould not have said why. He rushed to explain himself, anyway. “I don’t mean to be rude. I’m sorry.\\nIt’s just that no one comes into the Two Rivers except the merchants, and peddlers when the snow\\nisn’t too deep to get down from Baerlon. Almost no one. Certainly no one like you. The merchants’\\nguards sometimes say this is the back end of forever, and I suppose it must seem that way to anyone\\nfrom outside. I just wondered.”\\nHer smile did fade then, slowly, as if something had been recalled to her. For a moment she\\nmerely looked at him. “I am a student of history,” she said at last, “a collector of old stories. This\\nplace you call the Two Rivers has always interested me. Sometimes I study the stories of what\\nhappened here long ago, here and at other places.”\\n“Stories?” Rand said. “What ever happened in the Two Rivers to interest someone like—I\\nmean, what could have happened here?”\\n“And what else would you call it beside the Two Rivers?” Mat added. “That’s what it has'),\n",

Men wear many names, many faces. Different faces, but always the same\\nman. Yet no one knows the Great Pattern the Wheel weaves, or even the Pattern of an Age. We can\\nonly watch, and study, and hope.”\\nRand stared at her, unable to say a word, even to ask what she meant. He was not sure she had\\nmeant for them to hear. The other two were just as tongue-tied, he noticed. Ewin’s mouth hung open.\\nMoiraine focused on them again, and all three gave a little shake as if waking up. “Later we will\\ntalk,” she said. None of them said a word. “Later.” She moved on toward the Wagon Bridge,\\nappearing to glide over the ground rather than walk, her cloak spreading on either side of her like\\nwings.\\nAs she left, a tall man Rand had not noticed before moved away from the front of the inn and\\nfollowed her, one hand resting on the long hilt of a sword. His clothes were a dark grayish green that\\nwould have faded into leaf or shadow, and his cloak swirled through shades of gray and green and\\nbrown as it shifted in the wind. It almost seemed to disappear at times, that cloak, fading into\\nwhatever lay beyond it. His hair was long, and gray at the temples, held back from his face by a\\nnarrow leather headband. That face was made from stony planes and angles, weathered but unlined\\ndespite the gray in his hair. When he moved, Rand could think of nothing but a wolf.\\nIn passing the three youths his gaze ran over them, eyes as cold and blue as a midwinter dawn. It\\nwas as if he were weighing them in his mind, and there was no sign on his face of what the scales told\\nhim. He quickened his pace until he caught up to Moiraine, then slowed to walk by her shoulder,\\nbending to speak to her. Rand let out a breath he had not realized he had been holding.\\n“That was Lan,” Ewin said throatily, as if he, too, had been holding his breath. It had been that\\nkind of look. “I’ll bet he’s a Warder.”\\n“Don’t be a fool.” Mat laughed, but it was a shaky laugh. “Warders are just in stories. Anyway,\\nWarders have swords and armor covered in gold and jewels, and spend all their time up north, in the\\nGreat Blight, fighting evil and Trollocs and such.”\\n“He \\ncould\\n be a Warder,” Ewin insisted.\\n“Did you see any gold or jewels on him?” Mat scoffed. “Do we have Trollocs in the Two\\nRivers? We have sheep. I wonder what could ever have happened here to interest someone like her.”\\n“Something could have,” Rand answered slowly. “They say the inn’s been here for a thousand\\nyears, maybe more.”\\n“A thousand years of sheep,” Mat said.\\n“A silver penny!” Ewin burst out. “She gave me a whole silver penny! Think what I can buy\\nwhen the peddler comes.”\\nRand opened his hand to look at the coin she had given him, and almost dropped it in surprise.\\nHe did not recognize the fat silver coin with the raised image of a woman balancing a single flame on\\nher upturned hand, but he had watched while Bran al’Vere weighed out the coins merchants brought\\nfrom a dozen lands, and he had an idea of its value. That much silver would buy a good horse\\nanywhere in the Two Rivers, with some left over.\\nHe looked at Mat and saw the same stunned expression he knew must be on his own face. Tilting\\nhis hand so Mat could see the coin but not Ewin, he raised a questioning eyebrow. Mat nodded, and\\nfor a minute they stared at one another in perplexed wonder.\\n“What kind of chores does she have?” Rand asked finally.\\n“I don’t know,” Mat said firmly, “and I don’t care. I won’t spend it, either. Even when the'),\n",

He was not sure why, but somehow what Mat said\\nseemed right. The coin should not be spent. Not when it came from her. He could not think of anything\\nelse silver was good for, but. . . .\\n“Do you think I should keep mine, too?” Anguished indecision painted Ewin’s face.\\n“Not unless you want to,” Mat said.\\n“I think she gave it to you to spend,” Rand said.\\nEwin looked at his coin, then shook his head and stuffed the silver penny into his pocket. “I’ll\\nkeep it,” he said mournfully.\\n“There’s still the gleeman,” Rand said, and the younger boy brightened.\\n“If he ever wakes up,” Mat added.\\n“Rand,” Ewin asked, “\\nis\\n there a gleeman?”\\n“You’ll see,” Rand answered with a laugh. It was clear Ewin would not believe until he set eyes\\non the gleeman. “He has to come down sooner or later.”\\nShouting drifted across the Wagon Bridge, and when Rand looked to see what was causing it, his\\nlaughter became wholehearted. A milling crowd of villagers, from gray-haired oldsters to toddlers\\nbarely able to walk, escorted a tall wagon toward the bridge, a huge wagon drawn by eight horses,\\nthe outside of its rounded canvas cover hung about with bundles like bunches of grapes. The peddler\\nhad come at last. Strangers and a gleeman, fireworks and a peddler. It was going to be the best Bel\\nTine ever.\\n'),\n",

Still surrounded by a cloud of villagers and farmers come for Festival, the\\npeddler reined his horses to a stop in front of the inn. From every direction people streamed to swell\\nthe numbers around the great wagon, its wheels taller than any of the people with their eyes fastened\\nto the peddler above them on the wagon seat.\\nThe man on the wagon was Padan Fain, a pale, skinny fellow with gangly arms and a massive\\nbeak of a nose. Fain, always smiling and laughing as if he knew a joke that no one else knew, had\\ndriven his wagon and team into Emond’s Field every spring for as long as Rand could remember.\\nThe door of the inn flew open even as the team halted in a jangle of harness, and the Village\\nCouncil appeared, led by Master al’Vere and Tam. They marched out deliberately, even Cenn Buie,\\namid all the excited shouting of the others for pins or lace or books or a dozen other things.\\nReluctantly the crowd parted to let them to the fore, everyone closing in quickly behind and never\\nstopping their calling to the peddler. Most of all, the villagers called for news.\\nIn the eyes of the villagers, needles and tea and the like were no more than half the freight in a\\npeddler’s wagon. Every bit as important was word of outside, news of the world beyond the Two\\nRivers. Some peddlers simply told what they knew, throwing it out in a heap, a pile of rubbish with\\nwhich they could not be bothered. Others had to have every word dragged out of them, speaking\\ngrudgingly, with a bad grace. Fain, however, spoke freely if often teasingly, and spun out the telling,\\nmaking a show to rival a gleeman. He enjoyed being the center of attention, strutting around like an\\nunder-sized rooster, with every eye on him. It occurred to Rand that Fain might not be best pleased to\\nfind a real gleeman in Emond’s Field.\\nThe peddler gave the Council and villagers alike exactly the same attention as he fussed with\\ntying his reins off just so, which was to say hardly any attention at all. He nodded casually at no one\\nin particular. He smiled without speaking, and waved absently to people with whom he was\\nparticularly friendly, though his friendliness had always been of a peculiarly distant kind,\\nbackslapping without ever getting close.\\nThe demands for him to speak grew louder, but Fain waited, fiddling with small tasks about the\\ndriver’s seat, for the crowd and the anticipation to reach the size he wanted. The Council alone kept\\nsilent. They maintained the dignity befitting their position, but increasing clouds of pipesmoke rising\\nabove their heads showed the effort of it.\\nRand and Mat edged into the crowd, getting as close to the wagon as they could. Rand would\\nhave stopped halfway, but Mat wriggled through the press, pulling Rand behind him, until they were'),\n",

Half a head shorter than Rand, the curly-haired blacksmith’s\\napprentice was so stocky as to seem a man and a half wide, with arms and shoulders thick enough to\\nrival those of Master Luhhan himself. He could easily have pushed through the throng, but that was not\\nhis way. He picked his path carefully, offering apologies to people who had only half a mind to notice\\nanything but the peddler. He made the apologies anyway, and tried not to jostle anyone as he worked\\nthrough the crowd to Rand and Mat. “Imagine it,” he said when he finally reached them. “Bel Tine\\nand a peddler, both together. I’ll bet there really are fireworks.”\\n“You don’t know a quarter of it.” Mat laughed.\\nPerrin eyed him suspiciously, then looked a question at Rand.\\n“It’s true,” Rand shouted, then gestured at the growing mass of people, all giving voice. “Later.\\nI’ll explain later. Later, I said!”\\nAt that moment Padan Fain stood up on the wagon seat, and the crowd quieted in an instant.\\nRand’s last words exploded into utter silence, catching the peddler with an arm raised dramatically\\nand his mouth open. Everybody turned to stare at Rand. The bony little man on the wagon, prepared to\\nhave everyone hanging on his first words, gave Rand a sharp, searching look.\\nRand’s face reddened, and he wished he were Ewin’s size so he did not stand out so clearly. His\\nfriends shifted uncomfortably, too. It had only been the year before that Fain had taken notice of them\\nfor the first time, acknowledging them as men. Fain did not usually have time for anyone too young to\\nbuy a good deal of things off his wagon. Rand hoped he had not been relegated to a child again in the\\npeddler’s eyes.\\nWith a loud harrumph, Fain tugged at his heavy cloak. “No, not later,” the peddler declaimed,\\nonce more throwing up a hand grandly. “I will be telling you now.” As he spoke he made broad\\ngestures, casting his words over the crowd. “You are thinking you have had troubles in the Two\\nRivers, are you? Well, all the world has troubles, from the Great Blight south to the Sea of Storms,\\nfrom the Aryth Ocean in the west to the Aiel Waste in the east. And even beyond. The winter was\\nharsher than you’ve ever seen before, cold enough to jell your blood and crack your bones? Ahhh!\\nWinter was cold and harsh everywhere. In the Borderlands they’d be calling your winter spring. But\\nspring does not come, you say? Wolves have killed your sheep? Perhaps wolves have attacked men?\\nIs that the way of it? Well, now. Spring is late everywhere. There are wolves everywhere, all hungry\\nfor any flesh they can sink a tooth into, be it sheep or cow or man. But there are things worse than\\nwolves or winter. There are those who would be glad to have only your little troubles.” He paused\\nexpectantly.\\n“What could be worse than wolves killing sheep, and men?” Cenn Buie demanded. Others\\nmuttered in support.\\n“Men killing men.” The peddler’s reply, in portentous tones, brought shocked murmurs that\\nincreased as he went on. “It is war I mean. There is war in Ghealdan, war and madness. The snows of\\nthe Dhallin Forest are red with the blood of men. Ravens and the cries of ravens fill the air. Armies\\nmarch to Ghealdan. Nations, great houses and great men, send their soldiers to fight.”\\n“War?” Master al’Vere’s mouth fit awkwardly around the unfamiliar word. No one in the Two\\nRivers had ever had anything to do with a war. “Why are they having a war?”\\nFain grinned, and Rand had the feeling he was mocking the villagers’ isolation from the world,\\nand their ignorance. The peddler leaned forward as if he were about to impart a secret to the Mayor,\\nbut his whisper was meant to carry and did. “The standard of the Dragon has been raised, and men'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '../example_data/wot-1.pdf', 'page': 36, 'page_label': '37'}, page_content='flock to oppose. And to support.”\\nOne long gasp left every throat together, and Rand shivered in spite of himself.\\n“The Dragon!” someone moaned. “The Dark One’s loose in Ghealdan!”\\n“Not the Dark One,” Haral Luhhan growled. “The Dragon’s not the Dark One. And this is a false\\nDragon, anyway.”\\n“Let’s hear what Master Fain has to say,” the Mayor said, but no one would be quieted that\\neasily. People cried out from every side, men and women shouting over one another.\\n“Just as bad as the Dark One!”\\n“The Dragon broke the world, didn’t he?”\\n“He started it! He caused the Time of Madness!”\\n“You know the prophecies! When the Dragon is reborn, your worst nightmares will seem like\\nyour fondest dreams!”\\n“He’s just another false Dragon. He must be!”\\n“What difference does that make? You remember the last false Dragon. He started a war, too.\\nThousands died, isn’t that right, Fain? He laid siege to Illian.”\\n“It’s evil times! No one claiming to be the Dragon Reborn for twenty years, and now three in the\\nlast five years. Evil times! Look at the weather!”\\nRand exchanged looks with Mat and Perrin. Mat’s eyes shone with excitement, but Perrin wore a\\nworried frown. Rand could remember every tale he had heard about the men who named themselves\\nthe Dragon Reborn, and if they had all proven themselves false Dragons by dying or disappearing\\nwithout fulfilling any of the prophecies, what they had done was bad enough. Whole nations torn by\\nbattle, and cities and towns put to the torch. The dead fell like autumn leaves, and refugees clogged\\nthe roads like sheep in a pen. So the peddlers said, and the merchants, and no one in the Two Rivers\\nwith any sense doubted it. The world would end, so some said, when the real Dragon was born again.\\n“Stop this!” the Mayor shouted. “Be quiet! Stop working yourselves to a lather out of your own\\nimaginations. Let Master Fain tell us about this false Dragon.” The people began to quieten, but Cenn\\nBuie refused to be silent.\\n“\\nIs\\n this a false Dragon?” the thatcher asked sourly.\\nMaster al’Vere blinked as if taken by surprise, then snapped, “Don’t be an old fool, Cenn!” But\\nCenn had kindled the crowd again.\\n“He can’t be the Dragon Reborn! Light help us, he can’t be!”\\n“You old fool, Buie! You \\nwant\\n bad luck, don’t you?”\\n“Be naming the Dark One, next! You’re taken by the Dragon, Cenn Buie! Trying to bring us all\\nharm!”\\nCenn looked around defiantly, trying to stare down the glowers, and raised his voice. “I didn’t\\nhear Fain say this was a false Dragon. Did you? Use your eyes! Where are the crops that should be\\nknee high or better? Why is it still winter when spring should be here a month?” There were angry\\nshouts for Cenn to hold his tongue. “I will not be silent! I’ve no liking for this talk, either, but I won’t\\nhide my head under a basket till a Taren Ferry man comes to cut my throat. And I won’t dangle on\\nFain’s pleasure, not this time. Speak it out plain, peddler. What have you heard? Eh? Is this man a\\nfalse Dragon?”\\nIf Fain was perturbed by the news he brought or the upset he had caused, he gave no sign of it.\\nHe merely shrugged and laid a skinny finger alongside his nose. “As to that, now, who can say until it\\nis over and done?” He paused with one of his secretive grins, running his eyes over the crowd as if\\nimagining how they would react and finding it funny. “I do know,” he said, too casually, “that he can'),\n",

Get away with you!”\\n“Hold steady, Cenn,” Tam growled. “The boy is just curious. There’s no need of this foolishness\\nfrom you.”\\n“Act your age,” Bran added. “And for once remember you’re a member of the Council.”\\nCenn’s wrinkled face grew darker with every word from Tam and the Mayor, until it was almost\\npurple. “You know what kind of women he’s talking about. Stop frowning at me, Luhhan, and you,\\ntoo, Crawe. This is a decent village of decent folk, and it’s bad enough to have Fain here talking\\nabout false Dragons using the Power without this Dragon-possessed fool of a boy bringing Aes Sedai\\ninto it. Some things just shouldn’t be talked about, and I don’t care if you will be letting that fool\\ngleeman tell any kind of tale he wants. It isn’t right or decent.”\\n“I never saw or heard or smelled anything that couldn’t be talked about,” Tam said, but Fain was\\nnot finished.\\n“The Aes Sedai are already into it,” the peddler spoke up. “A party of them has ridden south\\nfrom Tar Valon. Since he can wield the Power, none but Aes Sedai can defeat him, for all the battles\\nthey fight, or deal with him once he’s defeated. If he is defeated.”\\nSomeone in the crowd moaned aloud, and even Tam and Bran exchanged uneasy frowns.\\nHuddles of villagers clumped together, and some pulled their cloaks tighter around themselves,\\nthough the wind had actually lessened.\\n“Of course, he’ll be defeated,” someone shouted.\\n“They’re always beaten in the end, false Dragons.”\\n“He has to be defeated, doesn’t he?”\\n“What if he isn’t?”\\nTam had finally managed to speak quietly into the Mayor’s ear, and Bran, nodding from time to\\ntime and ignoring the hubbub around them, waited until he was finished before raising his own voice.\\n“All of you listen. Be quiet and listen!” The shouting died to a murmur again. “This goes beyond\\nmere news from outside. It must be discussed by the Village Council. Master Fain, if you will join us\\ninside the inn, we have questions to ask.”\\n“A good mug of hot mulled wine would not go far amiss with me just now,” the peddler replied\\nwith a chuckle. He jumped down from the wagon, dusted his hands on his coat, and cheerfully righted\\nhis cloak. “Will you be looking after my horses, if you please?”\\n“I want to hear what he has to say!” More than one voice was raised in protest.\\n“You can’t take him off! My wife sent me to buy pins!” That was Wit Congar; he hunched his\\nshoulders at the stares some of the others gave him, but he held his ground.\\n“We’ve a right to ask questions, too,” somebody back in the crowd shouted. “I—”'),\n",

Pounding on the door brought only a single shout from the\\nMayor.\\n“Go home!”\\nPeople milled around in front of the inn muttering about what the peddler had said, and what it\\nmeant, and what questions the Council was asking, and why they should be allowed to listen and ask\\nquestions of their own. Some peered in through the front windows of the inn, and a few even\\nquestioned Hu and Tad, though it was far from clear what they were supposed to know. The two\\nstolid stablemen just grunted in reply and went on methodically removing the team’s harness. One by\\none they led Fain’s horses away and, when the last was gone, did not return.\\nRand ignored the crowd. He took a seat on the edge of the old stone foundation, gathered his\\ncloak around him, and stared at the inn door. Ghealdan. Tar Valon. The very names were strange and\\nexciting. They were places he knew only from peddlers’ news, and tales told by merchants’ guards.\\nAes Sedai and wars and false Dragons: those were the stuff of stories told late at night in front of the\\nfireplace, with one candle making strange shapes on the wall and the wind howling against the\\nshutters. On the whole, he believed he would rather have blizzards and wolves. Still, it must be\\ndifferent out there, beyond the Two Rivers, like living in the middle of a gleeman’s tale. An\\nadventure. One long adventure. A whole lifetime of it.\\nSlowly the villagers dispersed, still muttering and shaking their heads. Wit Congar paused to\\nstare into the now-abandoned wagon as though he might find another peddler hidden inside. Finally\\nonly a few of the younger folk were left. Mat and Perrin drifted over to where Rand sat.\\n“I don’t see how the gleeman could beat this,” Mat said excitedly. “I wonder if we might get to\\nsee this false Dragon?”\\nPerrin shook his shaggy head. “I don’t want to see him. Somewhere else, maybe, but not in the\\nTwo Rivers. Not if it means war.”\\n“Not if it means Aes Sedai here, either,” Rand added. “Or have you forgotten who caused the\\nBreaking? The Dragon may have started it, but it was Aes Sedai who actually broke the world.”\\n“I heard a story once,” Mat said slowly, “from a wool-buyer’s guard. He said the Dragon would\\nbe reborn in mankind’s greatest hour of need, and save us all.”\\n“Well, he was a fool if he believed that,” Perrin said firmly. “And you were a fool to listen.” He\\ndid not sound angry; he was slow to anger. But he sometimes got exasperated with Mat’s quicksilver\\nfancies, and there was a touch of that in his voice. “I suppose he claimed we’d all live in a new Age\\nof Legends afterwards, too.”\\n“I didn’t say I believed it,” Mat protested. “I just heard it. Nynaeve did, too, and I thought she\\nwas going to skin me and the guard both. He said—the guard did—that a lot of people do believe,\\nonly they’re afraid to say so, afraid of the Aes Sedai or the Children of the Light. He wouldn’t say any\\nmore after Nynaeve lit into us. She told the merchant, and he said it was the guard’s last trip with\\nhim.”\\n“A good thing, too,” Perrin said. “The Dragon going to save us? Sounds like Coplin talk to me.”\\n“What kind of need would be great enough that we’d want the Dragon to save us from it?” Rand\\nmused. “As well ask for help from the Dark One.”'),\n",

What more do you want?”\\n“I suppose.” Mat sighed, but the next moment he was grinning again. “Old Bili Congar says they\\ndon’t exist. Aes Sedai. Darkfriends. Says they’re just stories. He says he doesn’t believe in the Dark\\nOne, either.”\\nPerrin snorted. “Coplin talk from a Congar. What else can you expect?”\\n“Old Bili named the Dark One.

Rand scrambled\\nto his feet. Slender and barely taller than Mat’s shoulder, at the moment the Wisdom seemed taller\\nthan any of them, and it did not matter that she was young and pretty. “I suspected something of the\\nsort about Bili Congar at the time, but I thought you at least had more sense than to try taunting him\\ninto such a thing. You may be old enough to be married, Matrim Cauthon, but in truth you shouldn’t be\\noff your mother’s apron strings. The next thing, you’ll be naming the Dark One yourself.”\\n“No, Wisdom,” Mat protested, looking as if he would rather be anywhere else than there. “It\\nwas old Bil—I mean, Master Congar, not me! Blood and ashes, I—”\\n“Watch your tongue, Matrim!”\\nRand stood up straighter, though her glare was not directed at him. Perrin looked equally\\nabashed. Later one or another of them would almost certainly complain about being scolded by a\\nwoman not all that much older than themselves—someone always did after one of Nynaeve’s\\nscoldings, if never in her hearing—but the gap in ages always seemed more than wide enough when\\nface-to-face with her. Especially if she was angry. The stick in her hand was thick at one end and a\\nslender switch at the other, and she was liable to give a flail to anybody she thought was acting the\\nfool—head or hands or legs—no matter their age or position.\\nThe Wisdom so held his attention that at first Rand failed to see she was not alone.

His cloak seemed a mass of patches, in odd shapes and sizes, fluttering with\\nevery breath of air, patches in a hundred colors. It was really quite thick, Rand saw, despite what\\nMaster al’Vere had said, with the patches merely sewn on like decorations.\\n“The gleeman!” Egwene whispered excitedly.\\nThe white-haired man whirled, cloak flaring. His long coat had odd, baggy sleeves and big\\npockets. Thick mustaches, as snowy as the hair on his head, quivered around his mouth, and his face\\nwas gnarled like a tree that had seen hard times. He gestured imperiously at Rand and the others with\\na long-stemmed pipe, ornately carved, that trailed a wisp of smoke. Blue eyes peered out from under\\nbushy white brows, drilling into whatever he looked at.\\nRand stared at the man’s eyes almost as much as at the rest of him. Everybody in the Two Rivers\\nhad dark eyes, and so did most of the merchants, and their guards, and everyone else he had ever\\nseen. The Congars and the Coplins had made fun of him for his gray eyes, until the day he finally\\npunched Ewal Coplin in the nose; the Wisdom had surely gotten onto him for that. He wondered if\\nthere was a place where nobody had dark eyes. \\nMaybe Lan comes from there, too.\\n“What sort of place is this?” the gleeman demanded in a deep voice that sounded in some way\\nlarger than that of an ordinary man. Even in the open air it seemed to fill a great room and resonate\\nfrom the walls. “The yokels in that village on the hill tell me I can get here before dark, neglecting to\\nsay that that was only if I left well before noon. When I finally do arrive, chilled to the bone and\\nready for a warm bed, your innkeeper grumbles about the hour as if I were a wandering swineherd\\nand your Village Council hadn’t begged me to display my art at this festival of yours. And he never\\neven told me he was the Mayor.” He slowed for a breath, taking them all in with a glare, but he was\\noff again on the instant. “When I came downstairs to smoke my pipe before the fire and have a mug of\\nale, every man in the common room stares at me as if I were his least favorite brother-in-law seeking\\nto borrow money. One old grandfather starts ranting at me about the kind of stories I should or should\\nnot tell, then a girl-child shouts at me to get out, and threatens me with a great club when I don’t move\\nquickly enough for her. Who ever heard of treating a gleeman so?”\\nEgwene’s face was a study, her goggle-eyed amaze at a gleeman in the flesh marred by a desire\\nto defend Nynaeve.\\n“Your pardon, Master Gleeman,” Rand said.

Why, at her age\\nshe should better be flirting with the young men than foretelling the weather and curing the sick.”\\nRand shifted uncomfortably. He hoped Nynaeve never overheard the man’s opinion. At least, not\\nuntil he had done with his performing. Perrin winced at the gleeman’s words, and Mat whistled\\nsoundlessly, as if both had had the same thought as he had.\\n“The men were the Village Council,” Rand went on. “I’m sure they intended no discourtesy. You\\nsee, we just learned there’s a war in Ghealdan, and a man claiming to be the Dragon Reborn. A false\\nDragon. Aes Sedai are riding there from Tar Valon. The Council is trying to decide if we might be in\\ndanger here.”\\n“Old news, even in Baerlon,” the gleeman said dismissively, “and that is the last place in the\\nworld to hear anything.” He paused, looking around the village, and dryly added, “Almost the last\\nplace.” Then his eyes fell on the wagon in front of the inn, standing alone now, with its shafts on the\\nground. “So. I thought I recognized Padan Fain in there.” His voice was still deep, but the resonance\\nhad gone, replaced by scorn. “Fain was always one to carry bad news quickly, and the worse, the\\nfaster. There’s more raven in him than man.”\\n“Master Fain has come often to Emond’s Field, Master Gleeman,” Egwene said, a hint of\\ndisapproval finally breaking through her delight. “He is always full of laughter, and he brings much\\nmore good news than bad.”\\nThe gleeman eyed her for a moment, then smiled broadly. “Now you’re a lovely lass. You\\nshould have rose buds in your hair. Unfortunately, I cannot pull roses from the air, not this year, but\\nhow would you like to stand beside me tomorrow for a part of my performance? Hand me my flute\\nwhen I want it, and certain other apparatus. I always choose the prettiest girl I can find as my\\nassistant.”\\nPerrin snickered, and Mat, who had been snickering, laughed out loud. Rand blinked in surprise;\\nEgwene was glaring at him, and he had not even smiled. She straightened around and spoke in a too-\\ncalm voice.\\n“Thank you, Master Gleeman. I would be happy to assist you.”\\n“Thom Merrilin,” the gleeman said. They stared. “My name is Thom Merrilin, not Master\\nGleeman.” He hitched the multihued cloak up on his shoulders, and abruptly his voice once more\\nseemed to reverberate in a great hall. “Once a Courtbard, I am now indeed risen to the exalted rank of\\nMaster Gleeman, yet my name is plain Thom Merrilin, and gleeman is the simple title in which I\\nglory.” And he swept a bow so elaborate with flourishes of his cloak that Mat clapped and Egwene\\nmurmured appreciatively.\\n“Master . . . ah . . . Master Merrilin,” Mat said, unsure exactly what form of address to take out\\nof what Thom Merrilin had said, “what \\nis\\n happening in Ghealdan? Do you know anything about this\\nfalse Dragon? Or the Aes Sedai?”\\n“Do I look like a peddler, boy?” the gleeman grumbled, tapping out his pipe on the heel of his\\npalm. He made the pipe disappear somewhere inside his cloak, or his coat; Rand was not sure where\\nit had gone or how. “I am a gleeman, not a newsmonger.

Much safer that way.”\\n“But the war,” Mat began eagerly, only to be cut off by Master Merrilin.\\n“In wars, boy, fools kill other fools for foolish causes. That’s enough for anyone to know. I am\\nhere for my art.” Suddenly he thrust a finger at Rand. “You, lad. You’re a tall one. Not with your full\\ngrowth on you yet, but I doubt there’s another man in the district with your height.

Not many around here have gone as\\nfar.” He was not boasting; Perrin seldom did. He was just telling the truth.\\n“We’ve all seen the Mire, too,” Mat added, and he did sound boastful. “That’s the swamp at the\\nfar end of the Waterwood. Nobody at all goes there—it’s full of quicksands and bogs—except us.\\nAnd nobody goes to the Mountains of Mist, either, but we did, once. To the foot of them, anyway.”\\n“As far as that?” the gleeman murmured, brushing at his mustaches now continually. Rand\\nthought he was hiding a smile, and he saw that Perrin was frowning.\\n“It’s bad luck to enter the mountains,” Mat said, as if he had to defend himself for not going\\nfurther. “Everybody knows that.”\\n“That’s just foolishness, Matrim Cauthon,” Egwene cut in angrily. “Nynaeve says. . . .” She\\nbroke off, her cheeks turning pink, and the look she gave Thom Merrilin was not as friendly as it had\\nbeen. “It is not right to make. . . . It isn’t. . . .” Her face went redder, and she fell silent. Mat blinked,\\nas if he was just getting a suspicion of what had been going on.\\n“You’re right, child,” the gleeman said contritely. “I apologize humbly. I am here to entertain.\\nAah, my tongue has always gotten me into trouble.”\\n“Maybe we haven’t traveled as far as you,” Perrin said flatly, “but what does how tall Rand is\\nhave to do with anything?”\\n“Just this, lad. A little later I will let you try to pick me up, but you won’t be able to lift my feet\\nfrom the ground. Not you, nor your tall friend there—Rand, is it?—nor any other man. Now what do\\nyou think of that?”\\nPerrin snorted a laugh. “I think I can lift you right now.” But when he stepped forward Thom\\nMerrilin motioned him back.\\n“Later, lad, later. When there are more folk to watch. An artist needs an audience.”\\nA score of folk had gathered on the Green since the gleeman appeared from the inn, young men\\nand women down to children who peeked, wide-eyed and silent, from behind the older onlookers. All\\nlooked as if they were waiting for miraculous things from the gleeman.

So you can run tell the others. Eh? Just a taste of\\nwhat you’ll see tomorrow at your festival.”\\nHe took a step back, and suddenly leaped into the air, twisting and somersaulting to land facing\\nthem atop the old stone foundation. More than that, three balls—red, white, and black—began dancing\\nbetween his hands even as he landed.\\nA soft sound came from the watchers, half astonishment, half satisfaction. Even Rand forgot his\\nirritation.

Tell about his daughter Salya walking among the stars.”\\nRand looked at her out of the corner of his eye, but she seemed intent on the gleeman. She had\\nnever liked stories about adventures and long journeys. Her favorites were always the funny ones, or\\nstories about women outwitting people who were supposed to be smarter than everyone else. He was\\nsure she had asked for tales about Lenn and Salya to put a burr under his shirt. Surely she could see\\nthe world outside was no place for Two Rivers folk. Listening to tales of adventures, even dreaming\\nabout them, was one thing; having them take place around you would be something else again.\\n“Old stories, those,” Thom Merrilin said, and abruptly he was juggling three colored balls with\\neach hand. “Stories from the Age before the Age of Legends, some say. Perhaps even older. But I\\nhave \\nall\\n stories, mind you now, of Ages that were and will be. Ages when men ruled the heavens and\\nthe stars, and Ages when man roamed as brother to the animals.

Tales of Mosk the Giant, with his Lance of fire that could\\nreach around the world, and his wars with Elsbet, the Queen of All. Tales of Materese the Healer,\\nMother of the Wondrous Ind.”\\nThe balls now danced between Thom’s hands in two intertwining circles. His voice was almost\\na chant, and he turned slowly as he spoke, as if surveying the onlookers to gauge his effect. “I will tell\\nyou of the end of the Age of Legends, of the Dragon, and his attempt to free the Dark One into the\\nworld of men. I will tell of the Time of Madness, when Aes Sedai shattered the world; of the Trolloc\\nWars, when men battled Trollocs for rule of the earth; of the War of the Hundred Years, when men\\nbattled men and the nations of our day were wrought.

For a moment Thom looked at Moiraine\\nsideways, his face and body still except for making the balls disappear into his capacious coat\\nsleeves. Then he bowed to her, holding his cloak wide. “Your pardon, but you are surely not from this\\ndistrict?”\\n“Lady!” Ewin hissed fiercely. “The Lady Moiraine.”\\nThom blinked, then bowed again, more deeply. “Your pardon again . . . ah, Lady.

Surely it could not\\nbe anything better than a gleeman.\\n“That is a matter of taste, Master Bard,” Moiraine replied. “Some stories I like, and some I do\\nnot.”\\nThom’s bow was his deepest yet, bending his long body parallel to the ground. “I assure you,\\nnone of my stories will displease.

Thom stared after them, bushy brows drawn down, stroking\\nhis long mustaches with a knuckle, until they were halfway up the Green. \\nHe’s not pleased at all,\\nRand thought.\\n“Are you going to juggle some more, now?” Ewin demanded.\\n“Eat fire,” Mat shouted. “I want to see you eat fire.”\\n“The harp!” a voice cried from the crowd. “Play the harp!” Someone else called for the flute.\\nAt that moment the door of the inn opened and the Village Council trundled out, Nynaeve in their\\nmidst. Padan Fain was not with them, Rand saw; apparently the peddler had decided to remain in the\\nwarm common room with his mulled wine.\\nMuttering about “a strong brandy,” Thom Merrilin abruptly jumped down from the old\\nfoundation. He ignored the cries of those who had been watching him, pressing inside past the\\nCouncilors before they were well out of the doorway.\\n“Is he supposed to be a gleeman or a king?” Cenn Buie asked in annoyed tones. “A waste of\\ngood money, if you ask me.”\\nBran al’Vere half turned after the gleeman, then shook his head. “That man may be more trouble\\nthan he’s worth.”\\nNynaeve, busy gathering her cloak around her, sniffed loudly. “Worry about the gleeman if you\\nwant, Brandelwyn al’Vere. At least he is in Emond’s Field, which is more than you can say for this\\nfalse Dragon. But as long as you are worrying, there are others here who \\nshould\\n excite your worry.”\\n“If you please, Wisdom,” Bran said stiffly, “kindly leave who should worry me to my deciding.\\nMistress Moiraine and Master Lan are guests in my inn, and decent, respectable folk, so I say. Neither\\nof \\nthem\\n has called me a fool in front of the whole Council. Neither of \\nthem\\n has told the Council it\\nhasn’t a full set of wits among them.”\\n“It seems my estimate was too high by half,” Nynaeve retorted. She strode away without a\\nbackward glance, leaving Bran’s jaw working as he searched for a reply.\\nEgwene looked at Rand as if she were going to speak, then darted after the Wisdom instead.\\nRand knew there must be some way to stop her from leaving the Two Rivers, but the only way he\\ncould think of was not one he was prepared to take, even if she was willing. And she had as much as\\nsaid she was not willing at all, which made him feel even worse.\\n“That young woman wants a husband,” Cenn Buie growled, bouncing on his toes. His face was\\npurple, and getting darker. “She lacks proper respect. We’re the Village Council, not boys raking her\\nyard, and—”\\nThe Mayor breathed heavily through his nose, and suddenly rounded on the old thatcher. “Be\\nquiet, Cenn! Stop acting like a black-veiled Aiel!” The skinny man froze on his toes in astonishment.'),\n",

It’s the same in every village.”\\n“What about the false Dragon?” Mat asked, and Perrin added eager murmurs. “What about the\\nAes Sedai?”\\nTam shook his head slowly. “Master Fain knew little more than he had already told. At least,\\nlittle of interest to us. Battles won or lost. Cities taken and retaken. All in Ghealdan, thank the Light. It\\nhasn’t spread, or had not the last Master Fain knew.”\\n“Battles interest me,” Mat said, and Perrin added, “What did he say about them?”\\n“Battles don’t interest me, Matrim,” Tam said. “But I’m sure he will be glad to tell you all about\\nthem later. What does interest me is that we shouldn’t have to worry about them here, as far as the\\nCouncil can tell. We can see no reason for Aes Sedai to come here on their way south. And as for the\\nreturn journey, they aren’t likely to want to cross the Forest of Shadows and swim the White River.”\\nRand and the others chuckled at the idea. There were three reasons why no one came into the\\nTwo Rivers except from the north, by way of Taren Ferry. The Mountains of Mist, in the west, were\\nthe first, of course, and the Mire blocked the east just as effectively. To the south was the White\\nRiver, which got its name from the way rocks and boulders churned its swift waters to froth. And\\nbeyond the White lay the Forest of Shadows. Few Two Rivers folk had ever crossed the White, and\\nfewer still returned if they did. It was generally agreed, though, that the Forest of Shadows stretched\\nsouth for a hundred miles or more without a road or a village, but with plenty of wolves and bears.\\n“So that’s an end to it for us,” Mat said. He sounded at least a little disappointed.\\n“Not quite,” Tam said. “Day after tomorrow we will send men to Deven Ride and Watch Hill,\\nand Taren Ferry, too, to arrange for a watch to be kept. Riders along the White and the Taren, both,\\nand patrols between. It should be done today, but only the Mayor agrees with me. The rest can’t see\\nasking anyone to spend Bel Tine off riding across the Two Rivers.”\\n“But I thought you said we didn’t have to worry,” Perrin said, and Tam shook his head.\\n“I said should not, boy, not did not. I’ve seen men die because they were sure that what should\\nnot happen, would not. Besides, the fighting will stir up all sorts of people. Most will just be trying to\\nfind safety, but others will be looking for a way to profit from the confusion. We’ll offer any of the\\nfirst a helping hand, but we must be ready to send the second type on their way.”\\nAbruptly Mat spoke up. “Can we be part of it? I want to, anyway. You know I can ride as well\\nas anyone in the village.”\\n“You want a few weeks of cold, boredom, and sleeping rough?” Tam chuckled. “Likely that’s\\nall there will be to it. I hope that’s all.

Rand, it’s time for us to be getting back to the farm.”\\nRand blinked in surprise. “I thought we were staying for Winternight.”\\n“Things need seeing to at the farm, and I need you with me.”'),\n",

He won’t laugh any louder\\ntoday than he will tomorrow.”\\n“Maybe,” Perrin said with a sidelong glance at Mat, “we should try finding some others who’ve\\nseen him. We’ll see just about everybody in the village tonight.” Mat’s scowl deepened, but he still\\ndid not say anything. All of them understood that Perrin meant they should find witnesses who were\\nmore reliable than Mat. “He won’t laugh any louder tomorrow,” Perrin added when Rand hesitated.\\n“And I’d just as soon have somebody else with us when we go to him.

The peddler’s team munched their oats in eight stalls, and Master al’Vere’s massive\\nDhurrans, the team he hired out when farmers had hauling beyond the abilities of their own horses,\\nfilled six more, but only three others were occupied.

The tall, deep-chested black stallion that swung up his head fiercely had to be Lan’s.\\nThe sleek white mare with an arched neck, her quick steps as graceful as a girl dancing, even in the\\nstall, could only belong to Moiraine.

Before Rand had taken two steps into the stable his father nodded to the stablemen and brought\\nBela out, wordlessly gathering up Rand as he went.\\nThey harnessed the shaggy mare in silence. Tam appeared so deep in thought that Rand held his\\ntongue. He did not really look forward to trying to convince his father about the black-cloaked rider,\\nmuch less the Mayor. Tomorrow would have to be time enough, when Mat and the rest had found\\nothers who had seen the man. If they found others.\\nAs the cart lurched into motion, Rand took his bow and quiver from the back, awkwardly belting\\nthe quiver at his waist as he half trotted alongside. When they reached the last row of houses in the\\nvillage, he nocked an arrow, carrying it half raised and partly drawn. There was nothing to see except\\nmostly leafless trees, but his shoulders tightened. The black rider could be on them before either of\\nthem knew it. There might not be time to draw the bow if he was not already halfway to it.\\nHe knew he could not keep up the tension on the bowstring for long. He had made the bow\\nhimself, and Tam was one of the few others in the district who could even draw it all the way to the\\ncheek. He cast around for something to take his mind off thinking about the dark rider. Surrounded by\\nthe forest, their cloaks flapping in the wind, it was not easy.\\n“Father,” he said finally, “I don’t understand why the Council had to question Padan Fain.” With\\nan effort he took his eyes off the woods and looked across Bela at Tam. “It seems to me, the decision\\nyou reached could have been made right on the spot. The Mayor frightened everybody half out of their\\nwits, talking about Aes Sedai and the false Dragon here in the Two Rivers.”\\n“People are funny, Rand. The best of them are. Take Haral Luhhan. Master Luhhan is a strong\\nman, and a brave one, but he can’t bear to see butchering done. Turns pale as a sheet.”\\n“What does that have to do with anything? Everybody knows Master Luhhan can’t stand the sight\\nof blood, and nobody but the Coplins and the Congars thinks anything of it.”\\n“Just this, lad. People don’t always think or behave the way you might believe they would.\\nThose folk back there . . . let the hail beat their crops into the mud, and the wind take off every roof in\\nthe district, and the wolves kill half their livestock, and they’ll roll up their sleeves and start from\\nscratch. They’ll grumble, but they won’t waste any time with it. But you give them just the thought of\\nAes Sedai and a false Dragon in Ghealdan, and soon enough they’ll start thinking that Ghealdan is not\\nthat far the other side of the Forest of Shadows, and a straight line from Tar Valon to Ghealdan\\nwouldn’t pass that much to the east of us. As if the Aes Sedai wouldn’t take the road through Caemlyn\\nand Lugard instead of traveling cross-country! By tomorrow morning half the village would have\\nbeen sure the entire war was about to descend on us. It would take weeks to undo. A fine Bel Tine\\nthat would make. So Bran gave them the idea before they could get it for themselves.\\n“They’ve seen the Council take the problem under consideration, and by now they’ll be hearing\\nwhat we decided. They chose us for the Village Council because they trust we can reason things out\\nin the best way for everybody. They trust our opinions. Even Cenn’s, which doesn’t say much for the\\nrest of us, I suppose. At any rate, they will hear there isn’t anything to worry about, and they’ll\\nbelieve it. It is not that they couldn’t reach the same conclusion, or would not, eventually, but this way\\nwe won’t have Festival ruined, and nobody has to spend weeks worrying about something that isn’t\\nlikely to happen. If it does, against all odds . . . well, the patrols will give us enough warning to do'),\n",

I truly don’t think it will come to that, though.”\\nRand puffed out his cheeks. Apparently, being on the Council was more complicated than he had\\nbelieved. The cart rumbled on along the Quarry Road.\\n“Did anyone besides Perrin see this strange rider?” Tam asked.\\n“Mat did, but—” Rand blinked, then stared across Bela’s back at his father. “You believe me? I\\nhave to go back. I have to tell them.” Tam’s shout halted him as he turned to run back to the village.\\n“Hold, lad, hold! Do you think I waited this long to speak for no reason?”\\nReluctantly Rand kept on beside the cart, still creaking along behind patient Bela. “What made\\nyou change your mind? Why can’t I tell the others?”\\n“They’ll know soon enough. At least, Perrin will. Mat, I’m not sure of.

A\\nhundred, maybe.”\\n“Perhaps so,” Tam said placidly. “He could be just a refugee from the troubles in Ghealdan, or\\nmore likely a thief who thinks the pickings will be easier here than in Baerlon or Taren Ferry. Even\\nso, no one around here has so much they can afford to have it stolen. If the man is trying to escape the\\nwar . . . well, that’s still no excuse for scaring people. Once the watch is mounted, it should either\\nfind him or frighten him off.”\\n“I hope it frightens him off. But why do you believe me now, when you didn’t this morning?”\\n“I had to believe my own eyes then, lad, and I saw nothing.” Tam shook his grizzled head. “Only\\nyoung men see this fellow, it seems. When Haral Luhhan mentioned Perrin jumping shadows, though,\\nit all came out. Jon Thane’s oldest son saw him, too, and so did Samel Crawe’s boy, Bandry. Well,\\nwhen four of you say you’ve seen a thing—and solid lads, all—we start thinking maybe it’s there\\nwhether we can see it or not. All except Cenn, of course. Anyway, that’s why we’re going home. With\\nboth of us away, this stranger could be up to any kind of mischief there. If not for Festival, I wouldn’t\\ncome back tomorrow, either. But we can’t make ourselves prisoners in our own homes just because\\nthis fellow is lurking about.”\\n“I didn’t know about Ban or Lem,” Rand said. “The rest of us were going to the Mayor\\ntomorrow, but we were worried he wouldn’t believe us, either.”\\n“Gray hairs don’t mean our brains have curdled,” Tam said dryly. “So you keep a sharp eye.\\nMaybe I’ll catch sight of him, too, if he shows up again.”\\nRand settled down to do just that. He was surprised to realize that his step felt lighter. The knots\\nwere gone from his shoulders. He was still scared, but it was not so bad as it had been. Tam and he\\nwere just as alone on the Quarry Road as they had been that morning, but in some way he felt as if the\\nentire village were with them.

In the Two Rivers that often included three or\\nfour generations under one roof, including aunts, uncles, cousins, and nephews. Tam and Rand were\\nconsidered out of the ordinary as much for being two men living alone as for farming in the\\nWestwood.\\nHere most of the rooms were on one floor, a neat rectangle with no wings or additions. Two\\nbedrooms and an attic storeroom fitted up under the steeply sloped thatch. If the whitewash was all\\nbut gone from the stout wooden walls after the winter storms, the house was still in a tidy state of\\nrepair, the thatch tightly mended and the doors and shutters well-hung and snug-fitting.\\nHouse, barn, and stone sheep pen formed the points of a triangle around the farmyard, where a\\nfew chickens had ventured out to scratch at the cold ground. An open shearing shed and a stone\\ndipping trough stood next to the sheep pen. Hard by the fields between the farmyard and the trees\\nloomed the tall cone of a tight-walled curing shed. Few farmers in the Two Rivers could make do\\nwithout both wool and tabac to sell when the merchants came.\\nWhen Rand took a look in the stone pen, the heavy-horned herd ram looked back at him, but most\\nof the black-faced flock remained placidly where they lay, or stood with their heads in the feed\\ntrough. Their coats were thick and curly, but it was still too cold for shearing.\\n“I don’t think the black-cloaked man came here,” Rand called to his father, who was walking\\nslowly around the farmhouse, spear held at the ready, examining the ground intently. “The sheep\\nwouldn’t be so settled if that one had been around.”\\nTam nodded but did not stop. When he had made a complete circuit of the house, he did the same\\naround the barn and the sheep pen, still studying the ground. He even checked the smokehouse and the\\ncuring shed. Drawing a bucket of water from the well, he filled a cupped hand, sniffed the water, and\\ngingerly touched it with the tip of his tongue. Abruptly he barked a laugh, then drank it down in a\\nquick gulp.\\n“I suppose he didn’t,” he told Rand, wiping his hand on his coat front. “All this about men and\\nhorses I can’t see or hear just makes me look crossways at everything.” He emptied the well water\\ninto another bucket and started for the house, the bucket in one hand and his spear in the other. “I’ll\\nstart some stew for supper.

Once he had unharnessed her and put her into a stall in the barn next to\\ntheir cow, he set his cloak aside and rubbed the mare down with handfuls of dry straw, then curried\\nher with a pair of brushes. Climbing the narrow ladder to the loft, he pitched down hay for her feed.\\nHe fetched a scoopful of oats for her as well, though there was little enough left and might be no more\\nfor a long while unless the weather warmed soon.

Whatever eggs had been\\nlaid needed to be gathered, too. There were only three.

The cabbages were\\nstunted, barely a sprout of the beans or peas showed, and there was not a sign of a beet. Not\\neverything had been planted, of course; only part, in hopes the cold might break in time to make a\\ncrop of some kind before the cellar was empty. It did not take long to finish hoeing, which would\\nhave suited him just fine in years past, but now he wondered what they would do if nothing came up\\nthis year. Not a pleasant thought. And there was still firewood to split.\\nIt seemed to Rand like years since there had \\nnot\\n been firewood to split. But complaining would\\nnot keep the house warm, so he fetched the axe, propped up bow and quiver beside the chopping\\nblock, and got to work. Pine for a quick, hot flame, and oak for long burning. Before long he was\\nwarm enough to put his coat aside. When the pile of split wood grew big enough, he stacked it against\\nthe side of the house, beside other stacks already there. Most reached all the way to the eaves.\\nUsually by this time of year the woodpiles were small and few, but not this year.

The\\nfull moon stood well above the treetops, shimmering pale and bulging as if about to fall on their\\nheads.

I’ve already carried in water for hot baths\\nbefore sleep.”\\n“Anything hot sounds good to me,” Rand said, snatching up his cloak and tossing it round his\\nshoulders.

A hot bath was what he wanted, to take away the sweat and soak the chill out, but that would\\ncome when there had been time to heat the big kettle in the back room.\\nTam rooted around in a cabinet and came up with a key as long as his hand. He twisted it in the\\nbig iron lock on the door. At Rand’s questioning look he said, “Best to be safe. Maybe I’m taking a\\nfancy, or maybe the weather is blacking my mood, but. . . .” He sighed and bounced the key on his\\npalm. “I’ll see to the back door,” he said, and disappeared toward the back of the house.\\nRand could not remember either door ever being locked.

A thick belt slanted around Tam’s waist, and\\nfrom the belt hung a sword, with a bronze heron on the black scabbard and another on the long hilt.\\nThe only men Rand had ever seen wearing swords were the merchants’ guards. And Lan, of course.\\nThat his father might own one had never even occurred to him. Except for the herons, the sword\\nlooked a good deal like Lan’s sword.\\n“Where did that come from?” he asked. “Did you get it from a peddler? How much did it cost?”\\nSlowly Tam drew the weapon; firelight played along the gleaming length. It was nothing at all\\nlike the plain, rough blades Rand had seen in the hands of merchants’ guards. No gems or gold\\nadorned it, but it seemed grand to him, nonetheless. The blade, very slightly curved and sharp on only\\none edge, bore another heron etched into the steel. Short quillons, worked to look like braid, flanked\\nthe hilt. It seemed almost fragile compared with the swords of the merchants’ guards; most of those\\nwere double-edged, and thick enough to chop down a tree.'),\n",

Can’t plow a field or harvest a crop\\nwith it.” For a long minute he stared at the sword as if wondering what he was doing with such a\\nthing. At last he let out a heavy sigh. “But if I am not just taken by a black fancy, if our luck runs sour,\\nmaybe in the next few days we’ll be glad I tucked it in that old chest, instead.” He slid the sword\\nsmoothly back into its sheath and wiped his hand on his shirt with a grimace. “The stew should be\\nready. I’ll dish it out while you fix the tea.”\\nRand nodded and got the tea canister, but he wanted to know everything. Why would Tam have\\nbought a sword? He could not imagine. And where had Tam come by it? How far away? No one ever\\nleft the Two Rivers; or very few, at least. He had always vaguely supposed his father must have gone\\noutside—his mother had been an outlander—but a sword . . . ? He had a lot of questions to ask once\\nthey had settled at the table.\\nThe tea water was boiling fiercely, and he had to wrap a cloth around the kettle’s handle to lift it\\noff the hook. Heat soaked through immediately. As he straightened from the fire, a heavy thump at the\\ndoor rattled the lock. All thoughts of the sword, or the hot kettle in his hand, flew away.\\n“One of the neighbors,” he said uncertainly. “Master Dautry wanting to borrow. . . .” But the\\nDautry farm, their nearest neighbor, was an hour away even in the daylight, and Oren Dautry,\\nshameless borrower that he was, was still not likely to leave his house by dark.\\nTam softly placed the stew-filled bowls on the table. Slowly he moved away from the table.\\nBoth of his hands rested on his sword hilt. “I don’t think—” he began, and the door burst open, pieces\\nof the iron lock spinning across the floor.\\nA figure filled the doorway, bigger than any man Rand had ever seen, a figure in black mail that\\nhung to his knees, with spikes at wrists and elbows and shoulders. One hand clutched a heavy, scythe-\\nlike sword; the other hand was flung up before his eyes as if to shield them from the light.\\nRand felt the beginnings of an odd sort of relief. Whoever this was, it was not the black-cloaked\\nrider. Then he saw the curled ram’s horns on the head that brushed the top of the doorway, and where\\nmouth and nose should have been was a hairy muzzle. He took in all of it in the space of one deep\\nbreath that he let out in a terrified yell as, without thinking, he hurled the hot kettle at that half-human\\nhead.\\nThe creature roared, part scream of pain, part animal snarl, as boiling water splashed over its\\nface. Even as the kettle struck, Tam’s sword flashed. The roar abruptly became a gurgle, and the huge\\nshape toppled back. Before it finished falling, another was trying to claw its way past. Rand glimpsed\\na misshapen head topped by spike-like horns before Tam struck again, and two huge bodies blocked\\nthe door. He realized his father was shouting at him.\\n“Run, lad! Hide in the woods!” The bodies in the doorway jerked as others outside tried to pull\\nthem clear. Tam thrust a shoulder under the massive table; with a grunt he heaved it over atop the\\ntangle. “There are too many to hold! Out the back! Go! Go! I’ll follow!”\\nEven as Rand turned away, shame filled him that he obeyed so quickly. He wanted to stay and\\nhelp his father, though he could not imagine how, but fear had him by the throat, and his legs moved\\non their own. He dashed from the room, toward the back of the house, as fast as he had ever run in his'),\n",

Crashes and shouts from the front door pursued him.\\nHe had his hands on the bar across the back door when his eye fell on the iron lock that was\\nnever locked. Except that Tam had done just that tonight. Letting the bar stay where it was, he darted\\nto a side window, flung up the sash and threw back the shutters. Night had replaced twilight\\ncompletely. The full moon and drifting clouds made dappled shadows chase one another across the\\nfarmyard.\\nShadows,\\n he told himself. Only shadows. The back door creaked as someone outside, or\\nsomething, tried to push it open. His mouth went dry. A crash shook the door in its frame and lent him\\nspeed; he slipped through the window like a hare going to ground, and cowered against the side of the\\nhouse. Inside the room, wood splintered like thunder.\\nHe forced himself up to a crouch, made himself peer inside, just with one eye, just at the corner\\nof the window. In the dark he could not make out much, but more than he really wanted to see. The\\ndoor hung askew, and shadowed shapes moved cautiously into the room, talking in low, guttural\\nvoices. Rand understood none of what was said; the language sounded harsh, unsuited to a human\\ntongue. Axes and spears and spiked things dully reflected stray glimmers of moonlight. Boots scraped\\non the floor, and there was a rhythmic click, as of hooves, as well.\\nHe tried to work moisture back into his mouth. Drawing a deep, ragged breath, he shouted as\\nloudly as he could. “They’re coming in the back!” The words came out in a croak, but at least they\\ncame out. He had not been sure they would. “I’m outside! Run, father!” With the last word he was\\nsprinting away from the farmhouse.\\nCoarse-voiced shouts in the strange tongue raged from the back room. Glass shattered, loud and\\nsharp, and something thudded heavily to the ground behind him. He guessed one of them had broken\\nthrough the window rather than try to squeeze through the opening, but he did not look back to see if\\nhe was right. Like a fox running from hounds he darted into the nearest moon-cast shadows as if\\nheaded for the woods, then dropped to his belly and slithered back to the barn and its larger, deeper\\nshadows. Something fell across his shoulders, and he thrashed about, not sure if he was trying to fight\\nor escape, until he realized he was grappling with the new hoe handle Tam had been shaping.\\nIdiot!\\n For a moment he lay there, trying to stop panting. \\nCoplin fool idiot!\\n At last he crawled on\\nalong the back of the barn, dragging the hoe handle with him. It was not much, but it was better than\\nnothing. Cautiously he looked around the corner at the farmyard and the house.\\nOf the creature that had jumped out after him there was no sign. It could be anywhere. Hunting\\nhim, surely. Even creeping up on him at that very moment.\\nFrightened bleats filled the sheep pen to his left; the flock milled as if trying to find an escape.\\nShadowed shapes flickered in the lighted front windows of the house, and the clash of steel on steel\\nrang through the darkness. Suddenly one of the windows burst outward in a shower of glass and wood\\nas Tam leaped through it, sword still in hand. He landed on his feet, but instead of running away from\\nthe house he dashed toward the back of it, ignoring the monstrous things scrambling after him through\\nthe broken window and the doorway.\\nRand stared in disbelief. Why was he not trying to get away? Then he understood. Tam had last\\nheard his voice from the rear of the house. “Father!” he shouted. “I’m over here!”\\nIn mid-stride Tam whirled, not running toward Rand, but at an angle away from him. “Run, lad!”\\nhe shouted, gesturing with the sword as if to someone ahead of him. “Hide!” A dozen huge forms\\nstreamed after him, harsh shouts and shrill howls shivering the air.\\nRand pulled back into the shadows behind the barn. There he could not be seen from the house,\\nin case any of the creatures were still inside. He was safe; for the moment, at least. But not Tam. Tam,'),\n",

His hands tightened on the hoe handle, and he had\\nto clench his teeth to stop a sudden laugh. A hoe handle.

But he could not let Tam face\\nwhat was chasing him alone.\\n“If I move like I was stalking a rabbit,” he whispered to himself, “they’ll never hear me, or see\\nme.” The eerie cries echoed in the darkness, and he tried to swallow. “More like a pack of starving\\nwolves.” Soundlessly he slipped away from the barn, toward the forest, gripping the hoe handle so\\nhard that his hands hurt.\\nAt first, when the trees surrounded him, he took comfort from them.

The howls of\\nTam’s pursuers no longer filled the night, but in the silence that replaced them he flinched every time\\nthe wind scraped one limb against another.

He hardly dared to breathe for fear he might be heard.\\nSuddenly a hand closed over his mouth from behind, and an iron grip seized his wrist.\\nFrantically he clawed over his shoulder with his free hand for some hold on the attacker.\\n“Don’t break my neck, lad,” came Tam’s hoarse whisper.\\nRelief flooded him, turning his muscles to water. When his father released him he fell to his\\nhands and knees, gasping as if he had run for miles. Tam dropped down beside him, leaning on one\\nelbow.\\n“I wouldn’t have tried that if I had thought how much you’ve grown in the last few years,” Tam\\nsaid softly. His eyes shifted constantly as he spoke, keeping a sharp watch on the darkness. “But I had\\nto make sure you didn’t speak out. Some Trollocs can hear like a dog. Maybe better.”\\n“But Trollocs are just. . . .” Rand let the words trail off. Not just a story, not after tonight. Those\\nthings could be Trollocs or the Dark One himself for all he knew. “Are you sure?” he whispered. “I\\nmean . . . Trollocs?”\\n“I’m sure. Though what brought them to the Two Rivers. . . . I never saw one before tonight, but\\nI’ve talked with men who have, so I know a little. Maybe enough to keep us alive. Listen closely. A\\nTrolloc can see better than a man in the dark, but bright lights blind them, for a time at least. That may\\nbe the only reason we got away from so many. Some can track by scent or sound, but they’re said to\\nbe lazy. If we can keep out of their hands long enough, they should give up.”\\nThat made Rand feel only a little better. “In the stories they hate men, and serve the Dark One.”\\n“If anything belongs in the Shepherd of the Night’s flocks, lad, it is Trollocs. They kill for the\\npleasure of killing, so I’ve been told. But that’s the end of my knowledge, except that they cannot be\\ntrusted unless they’re afraid of you, and then not far.”\\nRand shivered. He did not think he would want to meet anyone a Trolloc was afraid of. “Do you\\nthink they’re still hunting for us?”\\n“Maybe, maybe not. They don’t seem very smart. Once we got into the forest, I sent the ones\\nafter me off toward the mountains without much trouble.” Tam fumbled at his right side, then put his\\nhand close to his face. “Best act as if they are, though.”\\n“You’re hurt.”\\n“Keep your voice down. It’s just a scratch, and there is nothing to be done about it now, anyway.\\nAt least the weather seems to be warming.” He lay back with a heavy sigh. “Perhaps it won’t be too'),\n",

The trees\\ncut the worst of the wind, but what gusted through still sliced like a frozen knife. Hesitantly he\\ntouched Tam’s face, and winced. “You’re on fire. I have to get you to Nynaeve.”\\n“In a bit, lad.”\\n“We don’t have any time to waste. It’s a long way in the dark.” He scrambled to his feet and\\ntried to pull his father up. A groan barely stifled by Tam’s clenched teeth made Rand hastily ease him\\nback down.\\n“Let me rest a while, boy. I’m tired.”\\nRand pounded his fist on his thigh. Snug in the farmhouse, with a fire and blankets, plenty of\\nwater and willowbark, he might have been willing to wait for daybreak before hitching Bela and\\ntaking Tam into the village. Here was no fire, no blankets, no cart, and no Bela. But those things were\\nstill back at the house. If he could not carry Tam to them, perhaps he could bring some of them, at\\nleast, to Tam. If the Trollocs were gone. They had to go sooner or later.\\nHe looked at the hoe handle, then dropped it. Instead he drew Tam’s sword. The blade gleamed\\ndully in the pale moonlight. The long hilt felt odd in his hand; the weight and heft were strange. He\\nslashed at the air a few times before stopping with a sigh. Slashing at air was easy. If he had to do it\\nagainst a Trolloc he was surely just as likely to run instead, or freeze stiff so he could not move at all\\nuntil the Trolloc swung one of those odd swords and. . . . \\nStop it! It’s not helping anything!\\nAs he started to rise, Tam caught his arm. “Where are you going?”\\n“We need the cart,” he said gently. “And blankets.” He was shocked at how easily he pulled his\\nfather’s hand from his sleeve. “Rest, and I’ll be back.”\\n“Careful,” Tam breathed.\\nHe could not see Tam’s face in the moonlight, but he could feel his eyes on him. “I will be.” \\nAs\\ncareful as a mouse exploring a hawk’s nest,\\n he thought.\\nAs silently as another shadow, he slid into the darkness. He thought of all the times he had\\nplayed tag in the woods with his friends as children, stalking one another, straining not to be heard\\nuntil he put a hand on someone’s shoulder. Somehow he could not make this seem the same.\\nCreeping from tree to tree, he tried to make a plan, but by the time he reached the edge of the\\nwoods he had made and discarded ten. Everything depended on whether or not the Trollocs were still\\nthere. If they were gone, he could simply walk up to the house and take what he needed. If they were\\nstill there. . . . In that case, there was nothing for it but go back to Tam. He did not like it, but he could\\ndo Tam no good by getting killed.\\nHe peered toward the farm buildings. The barn and the sheep pen were only dark shapes in the\\nmoonlight. Light spilled from the front windows of the house, though, and through the open front door.\\nJust the candles father lit, or are there Trollocs waiting?\\nHe jumped convulsively at a nighthawk’s reedy cry, then sagged against a tree, shaking. This\\nwas getting him nowhere. Dropping to his belly, he began to crawl, holding the sword awkwardly\\nbefore him. He kept his chin in the dirt all the way to the back of the sheep pen.\\nCrouched against the stone wall, he listened. Not a sound disturbed the night. Carefully he eased\\nup enough to look over the wall. Nothing moved in the farmyard.

Four twisted bodies made a tangle in the remnants of the furnishings. Trollocs.\\nRand recognized one by its ram’s horns. The others were much the same, even in their\\ndifferences, a repulsive melange of human faces distorted by muzzles, horns, feathers, and fur. Their\\nhands, almost human, only made it worse. Two wore boots; the others had hooves. He watched\\nwithout blinking until his eyes burned. None of the Trollocs moved. They had to be dead. And Tam\\nwas waiting.\\nHe ran in through the front door and stopped, gagging at the stench. A stable that had not been\\nmucked out in months was the only thing he could think of that might come close to matching it. Vile\\nsmears defiled the walls. Trying to breathe through his mouth, he hurriedly began poking through the\\nmess on the floor. There had been a waterbag in one of the cupboards.\\nA scraping sound behind him sent a chill to his marrow, and he spun, almost falling over the\\nremains of the table.

A wolf’s muzzle jutted out below sunken eyes. Flat,\\nemotionless eyes, and all too human. Hairy, pointed ears twitched incessantly. It stepped over one of\\nits dead companions on sharp goat hooves.

Fear. “Others come back,\\nyou talk Myrddraal.” It took another step, one big hand coming to rest on its own sword hilt. “You put\\nsword down.”\\nRand wet his lips. Myrddraal! The worst of the stories was walking tonight. If a Fade was\\ncoming, it made a Trolloc pale by comparison. He had to get away.

He forced his lips into a shaky smile. “All right.” Grip\\ntightening on the sword, he let both hands drop to his sides. “I’ll talk.”\\nThe wolf-smile became a snarl, and the Trolloc lunged for him.

He had gotten it up in time after all. Blood\\ncovered Rand’s hands, as well, and made a blackish smear across the front of his shirt. His stomach\\nchurned, and he swallowed hard to keep from being sick. He shook as hard as he had in the worst of\\nhis fear, but this time in relief at still being alive.\\nOthers come back, the Trolloc had said. The other Trollocs would be returning to the farmhouse.\\nAnd a Myrddraal, a Fade. The stories said Fades were twenty feet tall, with eyes of fire, and they\\nrode shadows like horses.

Cleaning the sword, he reluctantly dropped the rag on the floor. There was no\\ntime for neatness, he thought with a laugh that he had to clamp his teeth shut to stop. He did not see\\nhow they could ever clean the house well enough for it to be lived in again. The horrible stench had\\nprobably already soaked right into the timbers. But there was no time to think of that. \\nNo time for\\nneatness. No time for anything, maybe.\\nHe was sure he was forgetting any number of things they would need, but Tam was waiting, and\\nthe Trollocs were coming back.

A waterbag\\nthat he carried when he took the sheep to pasture. A clean shirt. He did not know when he would have\\ntime to change, but he wanted to get out of his blood-smeared shirt at the first opportunity. The small\\nbags of willowbark and their other medicines were part of a dark, muddy-looking pile he could not\\nbring himself to touch.\\nOne bucket of the water Tam had brought in still stood by the fireplace, miraculously unspilled\\nand untouched.

He was not sure he could carry Tam as far as\\nthe village even if his father could bear to be carried. The pain of it might kill Tam more quickly than\\nthe fever.

The undamaged shaft stood\\nstraight out. Snatching up the sword he hacked at the well-seasoned ash. To his pleased surprise great\\nchips flew with his strokes, and he cut through as quickly as he could have with a good axe.\\nWhen the shaft fell free, he looked at the sword blade in wonder. Even the best-sharpened axe\\nwould have dulled chopping through that hard, aged wood, but the sword looked as brightly sharp as\\never. He touched the edge with his thumb, then hastily stuck it in his mouth. The blade was still razor-\\nsharp.\\nBut he had no time for wonder.

Not a heavy one, but hard to balance and manage, the\\ncart shafts shifting and twisting in his arms as he stumbled across the plowed field.

He hoped it was too low to be heard\\nby hunting Trollocs, too.\\nHastily he got on with what was needed. Three of the blankets he wove around and between the\\nshafts cut from the cart, contriving a makeshift litter. He would only be able to carry one end, letting\\nthe other drag on the ground, but it would have to do. From the last blanket he cut a long strip with his\\nbelt knife, then tied one end of the strip to each of the shafts.\\nAs gently as he could, he lifted Tam onto the litter, wincing with every moan. His father had\\nalways seemed indestructible. Nothing could harm him; nothing could stop him, or even slow him\\ndown.

He had to.\\nWhen Tam finally lay on the litter, Rand hesitated, then took the sword belt from his father’s\\nwaist. When he fastened it around himself, it felt odd there; it made him feel odd. Belt and sheath and\\nsword together only weighed a few pounds, but when he sheathed the blade it seemed to drag at him\\nlike a great weight.\\nAngrily he berated himself. This was no time or place for foolish fancies. It was only a big\\nknife. How many times had he daydreamed about wearing a sword and having adventures? If he could\\nkill one Trolloc with it, he could surely fight off any others as well. Only, he knew all too well that\\nwhat had happened in the farmhouse had been the purest luck. And his daydream adventures had\\nnever included his teeth chattering, or running for his life through the night, or his father at the point of\\ndeath.\\nHastily he tucked the last blanket around Tam, and laid the waterskin and the rest of the cloths\\nbeside his father on the litter. With a deep breath he knelt between the shafts and lifted the strip of\\nblanket over his head. It settled across his shoulders and under his arms. When he gripped the shafts\\nand straightened, most of the weight was on his shoulders. It did not seem like very much. Trying to\\nkeep a smooth pace, he set out for Emond’s Field, the litter scraping along behind him.\\nHe had already decided to make his way to the Quarry Road and follow that to the village. The\\ndanger would almost certainly be greater along the road, but Tam would receive no help at all if he\\ngot them lost trying to find his way through the woods and the dark.\\nIn the darkness he was almost out onto the Quarry Road before he knew it. When he realized\\nwhere he was, his throat tightened like a fist. Hurriedly he turned the litter around and dragged it back\\ninto the trees a way, then stopped to catch his breath and let his heart stop pounding. Still panting, he\\nturned east, toward Emond’s Field.\\nTraveling through the trees was more difficult than taking Tam down the road, and the night\\nsurely did not help, but going out onto the road itself would be madness. The idea was to reach the\\nvillage \\nwithout\\n meeting any Trollocs; without even seeing any, if he had his wish. He had to assume\\nthe Trollocs were still hunting them, and sooner or later they would realize the two had set off for the\\nvillage. That was the most likely place to go, and the Quarry Road the most likely route. In truth, he\\nfound himself closer to the road than he liked.

The almost constant struggle not to fall took as much out of\\nhim as did the actual work of pulling the litter. He had been up before dawn to begin his chores, and\\neven with the trip to Emond’s Field he had done almost a full day’s work.

He\\nseized Rand’s collar, pulling him close enough to feel the heat of his father’s fever in his own cheek.\\n“They called them savages,” Tam said urgently. “The fools said they could be swept aside like\\nrubbish. How many battles lost, how many cities burned, before they faced the truth? Before the\\nnations stood together against them?” He loosed his hold on Rand, and sadness filled his voice. “The\\nfield at Marath carpeted with the dead, and no sound but the cries of ravens and the buzzing of flies.\\nThe topless towers of Cairhien burning in the night like torches.

He could feel it, like grit scraping his bones, even before they drew\\nclose enough for moonlight to reveal the hooded cloak swathing the horseman, a cloak that hung\\nundisturbed by the wind.

All he\\nlet himself be aware of was the purpose he had fixed in his head. Bran al’Vere could do something to\\nhelp Tam. What that could be he tried not to dwell on. But the Mayor would be able to do something,\\nto think of something.\\nThe inn had almost completely escaped the destruction that had taken half the village. A few\\nscorch marks marred its walls, but the red roof tiles glittered in the sunlight as brightly as ever. All\\nthat was left of the peddler’s wagon, though, were blackened iron wheel-rims leaning against the\\ncharred wagon box, now on the ground. The big round hoops that had held up the canvas cover\\nslanted crazily, each at a different angle.\\nThom Merrilin sat cross-legged on the old foundation stones, carefully snipping singed edges\\nfrom the patches on his cloak with a pair of small scissors. He set down cloak and scissors when\\nRand drew near. Without asking if Rand needed or wanted help, he hopped down and picked up the\\nback of the litter.\\n“Inside? Of course, of course. Don’t you worry, boy. Your Wisdom will take care of him. I’ve\\nwatched her work, since last night, and she has a deft touch and a sure skill. It could be a lot worse.\\nSome died last night. Not many, perhaps, but any at all are too many for me. Old Fain just\\ndisappeared, and that’s the worst of all. Trollocs will eat anything. You should thank the Light your\\nfather’s still here, and alive for the Wisdom to heal.”\\nRand blotted out the words—\\nHe\\n is \\nmy father!\\n—reducing the voice to meaningless sound that he'),\n",

He could not bear any more sympathy, any more attempts to\\nboost his spirits. Not now. Not until Bran al’Vere told him how to help Tam.\\nSuddenly he found himself facing something scrawled on the inn door, a curving line scratched\\nwith a charred stick, a charcoal teardrop balanced on its point. So much had happened that it hardly\\nsurprised him to find the Dragon’s Fang marked on the door of the Winespring Inn. Why anyone\\nwould want to accuse the innkeeper or his family of evil, or bring the inn bad luck, was beyond him,\\nbut the night had convinced him of one thing. Anything was possible. Anything at all.\\nAt a push from the gleeman he lifted the latch, and went in.\\nThe common room was empty except for Bran al’Vere, and cold, too, for no one had found time\\nto lay a fire. The Mayor sat at one of the tables, dipping his pen in an inkwell with a frown of\\nconcentration on his face and his gray-fringed head bent over a sheet of parchment. Nightshirt tucked\\nhastily into his trousers and bagging around his considerable waist, he absently scratched at one bare\\nfoot with the toes of the other. His feet were dirty, as if he had been outside more than once without\\nbothering about boots, despite the cold. “What’s your trouble?” he demanded without looking up. “Be\\nquick with it. I have two dozen things to do right this minute, and more that should have been done an\\nhour ago. So I have little time or patience. Well? Out with it!”\\n“Master al’Vere?” Rand said. “It’s my father.”\\nThe Mayor’s head jerked up. “Rand? Tam!” He threw down the pen and knocked over his chair\\nas he leaped up. “Perhaps the Light hasn’t abandoned us altogether. I was afraid you were both dead.\\nBela galloped into the village an hour after the Trollocs left, lathered and blowing as if she’d run all\\nthe way from the farm, and I thought. . . . No time for that, now. We’ll take him upstairs.” He seized\\nthe rear of the litter, shouldering the gleeman out of the way. “You go get the Wisdom, Master\\nMerrilin. And tell her I said hurry, or I’ll know the reason why! Rest easy, Tam. We’ll soon have you\\nin a good, soft bed. Go, gleeman, go!”\\nThom Merrilin vanished through the doorway before Rand could speak. “Nynaeve wouldn’t do\\nanything. She said she couldn’t help him. I knew . . . I hoped you’d think of something.”\\nMaster al’Vere looked at Tam more sharply, then shook his head. “We will see, boy. We will\\nsee.” But he no longer sounded confident. “Let’s get him into a bed. He can rest easy, at least.”\\nRand let himself be prodded toward the stairs at the back of the common room. He tried hard to\\nkeep his certainty that somehow Tam would be all right, but it had been thin to begin with, he\\nrealized, and the sudden doubt in the Mayor’s voice shook him.\\nOn the second floor of the inn, at the front, were half a dozen snug, well-appointed rooms with\\nwindows overlooking the Green. Mostly they were used by the peddlers, or people down from Watch\\nHill or up from Deven Ride, but the merchants who came each year were often surprised to find such\\ncomfortable rooms. Three of them were taken now, and the Mayor hurried Rand to one of the unused\\nones.\\nQuickly the down comforter and blankets were stripped back on the wide bed, and Tam was\\ntransferred to the thick feather mattress, with goose-down pillows tucked under his head. He made no\\nsound beyond hoarse breathing as he was moved, not even a groan, but the Mayor brushed away\\nRand’s concern, telling him to set a fire to take the chill off the room. While Rand dug wood and\\nkindling from the woodbox next to the fireplace, Bran threw back the curtains on the window, letting\\nin the morning light, then began to gently wash Tam’s face. By the time the gleeman returned, the blaze\\non the hearth was warming the room.\\n“She will not come,” Thom Merrilin announced as he stalked into the room. He glared at Rand,\\nhis bushy white brows drawing down sharply. “You didn’t tell me she had seen him already. She'),\n",

I don’t know . . . maybe the Mayor could do something, could make her see. . . .”\\nHands clenched in anxious fists, Rand turned from the fireplace to Bran. “Master al’Vere, what can I\\ndo?” The rotund man shook his head helplessly. He laid a freshly dampened cloth on Tam’s forehead\\nand avoided meeting Rand’s eye. “I can’t just watch him die, Master al’Vere. I have to do\\nsomething.” The gleeman shifted as if to speak. Rand rounded on him eagerly. “Do you have an idea?\\nI’ll try anything.”\\n“I was just wondering,” Thom said, tamping his long-stemmed pipe with his thumb, “if the\\nMayor knew who scrawled the Dragon’s Fang on his door.” He peered into the bowl, then looked at\\nTam and replaced the unlit pipe between his teeth with a sigh. “Someone seems not to like him\\nanymore. Or maybe it’s his guests they don’t like.”\\nRand gave him a disgusted look and turned away to stare into the fire. His thoughts danced like\\nthe flames, and like the flames they concentrated fixedly on one thing. He would not give up. He could\\nnot just stand there and watch Tam die. \\nMy father,\\n he thought fiercely. \\nMy father.\\n Once the fever was\\ngone, that could be cleared up as well. But the fever first. Only, how?\\nBran al’Vere’s mouth tightened as he looked at Rand’s back, and the glare he directed at the\\ngleeman would have given a bear pause, but Thom just waited expectantly as if he had not noticed it.\\n“It’s probably the work of one of the Congars, or a Coplin,” the Mayor said finally, “though the\\nLight alone knows which. They’re a large brood, and if there’s ill to be said of someone, or even if\\nthere isn’t, they’ll say it. They make Cenn Buie sound honey-tongued.”\\n“That wagonload who came in just before dawn?” the gleeman asked. “They hadn’t so much as\\nsmelled a Trolloc, and all they wanted to know was when Festival was going to start, as if they\\ncouldn’t see half the village in ashes.”\\nMaster al’Vere nodded grimly. “One branch of the family. But none of them are very different.\\nThat fool Darl Coplin spent half the night demanding I put Mistress Moiraine and Master Lan out of\\nthe inn, out of the village, as if there would be any village at all left without them.”\\nRand had only half listened to the conversation, but this last tugged him to speak. “What did they\\ndo?”\\n“Why, she called ball lightning out of a clear night sky,” Master al’Vere replied. “Sent it darting\\nstraight at the Trollocs. You’ve seen trees shattered by it. The Trollocs stood it no better.”\\n“Moiraine?” Rand said incredulously, and the Mayor nodded.\\n“Mistress Moiraine. And Master Lan was a whirlwind with that sword of his. His sword? The\\nman himself is a weapon, and in ten places at once, or so it seemed. Burn me, but I still wouldn’t\\nbelieve it if I couldn’t step outside and see. . . .” He rubbed a hand over his bald head. “Winternight\\nvisits just beginning, our hands full of presents and honeycakes and our heads full of wine, then the\\ndogs snarling, and suddenly the two of them burst out of the inn, running through the village, shouting\\nabout Trollocs. I thought they’d had too much wine. After all . . . Trollocs? Then, before anyone knew\\nwhat was happening, those . . . those things were right in the streets with us, slashing at people with\\ntheir swords, torching houses, howling to freeze a man’s blood.” He made a sound of disgust in his\\nthroat. “We just ran like chickens with a fox in the henyard till Master Lan put some backbone into\\nus.”\\n“No need to be so hard,” Thom said. “You did as well as anyone could. Not every Trolloc lying\\nout there fell to the two of them.”\\n“Umm . . . yes, well.” Master al’Vere gave himself a shake. “It’s still almost too much to\\nbelieve. An Aes Sedai in Emond’s Field. And Master Lan is a Warder.”'),\n",

She doesn’t. . . .”\\n“Did you think they wore signs?” the Mayor said wryly. “ ‘Aes Sedai’ painted across their\\nbacks, and maybe, ‘Danger, stay away’?” Suddenly he slapped his forehead. “Aes Sedai. I’m an old\\nfool, and losing my wits. There’s a chance, Rand, if you’re willing to take it. I can’t tell you to do it,\\nand I don’t know if I’d have the nerve, if it were me.”\\n“A chance?” Rand said. “I’ll take any chance, if it’ll help.”\\n“Aes Sedai can heal, Rand. Burn me, lad, you’ve heard the stories. They can cure where\\nmedicines fail. Gleeman, you should have remembered that better than I. Gleemen’s tales are full of\\nAes Sedai. Why didn’t you speak up, instead of letting me flail around?”\\n“I’m a stranger here,” Thom said, looking longingly at his unlit pipe, “and Goodman Coplin isn’t\\nthe only one who wants nothing to do with Aes Sedai. Best the idea came from you.”\\n“An Aes Sedai,” Rand muttered, trying to make the woman who had smiled at him fit the stories.\\nHelp from an Aes Sedai was sometimes worse than no help at all, so the stories said, like poison in a\\npie, and their gifts always had a hook in them, like fishbait. Suddenly the coin in his pocket, the coin\\nMoiraine had given him, seemed like a burning coal. It was all he could do not to rip it out of his coat\\nand throw it out the window.\\n“Nobody wants to get involved with Aes Sedai, lad,” the Mayor said slowly. “It is the only\\nchance I can see, but it’s still no small decision. I cannot make it for you, but I have seen nothing but\\ngood from Mistress Moiraine . . . Moiraine Sedai, I should call her, I suppose. Sometimes”—he gave\\na meaningful look at Tam—“you have to take a chance, even if it’s a poor one.”\\n“Some of the stories are exaggerated, in a way,” Thom added, as if the words were being\\ndragged from him. “Some of them. Besides, boy, what choice do you have?”\\n“None,” Rand sighed. Tam still had not moved a muscle; his eyes were sunken as if he had been\\nsick a week. “I’ll . . . I’ll go find her.”\\n“The other side of the bridges,” the gleeman said, “where they are . . . disposing of the dead\\nTrollocs. But be careful, boy. Aes Sedai do what they do for reasons of their own, and they aren’t\\nalways the reasons others think.”\\nThe last was a shout that followed Rand through the door. He had to hold onto the sword hilt to\\nkeep the scabbard from tangling in his legs as he ran, but he would not take the time to remove it. He\\nclattered down the stairs and dashed out of the inn, tiredness forgotten for the moment. A chance for\\nTam, however small, was enough to overcome a night without sleep, for a time at least. That the\\nchance came from an Aes Sedai, or what the price of it might be, he did not want to consider. And as\\nfor actually facing an Aes Sedai. . . . He took a deep breath and tried to move faster.\\nThe bonfires stood well beyond the last houses to the north, on the Westwood side of the road to\\nWatch Hill. The wind still carried the oily black columns of smoke away from the village, but even\\nso a sickly sweet stink filled the air, like a roast left hours too long on the spit. Rand gagged at the\\nsmell, then swallowed hard when he realized its source. A fine thing to do with Bel Tine fires. The\\nmen tending the fires had cloths tied over their noses and mouths, but their grimaces made it plain the\\nvinegar dampening the cloths was not enough. Even if it did kill the stench, they still knew the stench\\nwas there, and they still knew what they were doing.\\nTwo of the men were untying the harness straps of one of the big Dhurrans from a Trolloc’s\\nankles. Lan, squatting beside the body, had tossed back the blanket enough to reveal the Trolloc’s\\nshoulders and goat-snouted head. As Rand trotted up the Warder unfastened a metal badge, a blood-\\nred enameled trident, from one spiked shoulder of the Trolloc’s shirt of black mail.\\n“Ko’bal,” he announced.

A\\nwalking staff, covered from end to end in carved vines and flowers, lay across her knees, and her\\ndress had the rumpled look of having been worn too long. “Seven bands. Seven! That many have not\\nacted together since the Trolloc Wars. Bad news piles on bad news. I am afraid, Lan.

She was no longer quite so pristine, not with wisps of her hair sticking out in all\\ndirections and a faint streak of soot across her nose, yet not really different, either. Surely there must\\nbe something about an Aes Sedai to mark her for what she was. On the other hand, if outward\\nappearance reflected what was inside, and if the stories were true, then she should look closer to a\\nTrolloc than to a more than handsome woman whose dignity was not dented by sitting in the dirt. And\\nshe could help Tam. Whatever the cost, there was that before anything else.\\nHe took a deep breath. “Mistress Moiraine . . . I mean, Moiraine Sedai.” Both turned to look at\\nhim, and he froze under her gaze. Not the calm, smiling gaze he remembered from the Green.

She raised her voice. “How are\\nyour dreams, Rand al’Thor?”\\nHe stared at her. “My dreams?”\\n“A night like that can give a man bad dreams, Rand. If you have nightmares, you must tell me of\\nit. I can help with bad dreams, sometimes.”\\n“There’s nothing wrong with my. . . . It’s my father. He’s hurt. It’s not much more than a scratch,\\nbut the fever is burning him up. The Wisdom won’t help.

Her attention never really left Tam, even while she spoke. “Sit over there. And you, too,\\nLan.” She gestured vaguely in the direction of a long bench against the wall.

He swung\\nhis eyes back to the bed. Tam’s breathing did sound easier; the rasp was gone. He was sure of it. “He\\nbought it a long time ago.”\\n“Strange thing for a sheepherder to buy.”\\nRand spared a sidelong look for Lan. For a stranger to wonder about the sword was prying. For\\na Warder to do it. . . . Still, he felt he had to say something. “He never had any use for it, that I know\\nof. He said it \\nhad\\n no use. Until last night, anyway. I didn’t even know he had it till then.”\\n“He called it useless, did he? He must not always have thought so.” Lan touched the scabbard at\\nRand’s waist briefly with one finger. “There are places where the heron is a symbol of the master\\nswordsman. That blade must have traveled a strange road to end up with a sheepherder in the Two\\nRivers.”\\nRand ignored the unspoken question. Moiraine still had not moved. \\nWas\\n the Aes Sedai doing\\nanything? He shivered and rubbed his arms, not sure he really wanted to know what she was doing.\\nAn Aes Sedai.\\nA question of his own popped into his head then, one he did not want to ask, one he needed an\\nanswer to. “The Mayor—” He cleared his throat, and took a deep breath. “The Mayor said the only\\nreason there’s anything left of the village is because of you and her.” He made himself look at the\\nWarder. “If you had been told about a man in the woods . . . a man who made people afraid just by\\nlooking at them . . . would that have warned you?

I am as much to blame. That accursed raven yesterday, the way it\\nbehaved, should have warned me. And you, too, my old friend.” Her tongue clicked angrily. “I was\\noverconfident to the point of arrogance, sure that the Dark One’s touch could not have spread so far.\\nNor so heavily, not yet.

Trolloc weapons are\\nmade at forges in the valley called Thakan’dar, on the very slopes of Shayol Ghul itself. Some of\\nthem take a taint from that place, a stain of evil in the metal.

One\\nhand she laid on his forehead; the other cupped the ivory figure. Eyes closed, her face took on a look\\nof concentration.

Believe me, the truth is big\\nenough with a Halfman. Halfman, Lurk, Fade, Shadowman; the name depends on the land you’re in,\\nbut they all mean Myrddraal. Fades are Trolloc spawn, throwbacks almost to the human stock the\\nDreadlords used to make the Trollocs. Almost. But if the human strain is made stronger, so is the taint\\nthat twists the Trollocs. Halfmen have powers of a kind, the sort that stem from the Dark One. Only\\nthe weakest Aes Sedai would fail to be a match for a Fade, one against one, but many a good man and\\ntrue has fallen to them. Since the wars that ended the Age of Legends, since the Forsaken were bound,\\nthey have been the brain that tells the Trolloc fists where to strike. In the days of the Trolloc Wars,\\nHalfmen led the Trollocs in battle, under the Dreadlords.”\\n“He scared me,” Rand said faintly. “He just looked at me, and. . . .” He shivered.\\n“No need for shame, sheepherder. They scare me, too. I’ve seen men who have been soldiers all\\ntheir lives freeze like a bird facing a snake when they confronted a Halfman. In the north, in the\\nBorderlands along the Great Blight, there is a saying. The look of the Eyeless is fear.”\\n“The Eyeless?” Rand said, and Lan nodded.\\n“Myrddraal see like eagles, in darkness or in light, but they have no eyes. I can think of few\\nthings more dangerous than facing a Myrddraal. Moiraine Sedai and I both tried to kill the one that\\nwas here last night, and we failed every time. Halfmen have the Dark One’s own luck.”\\nRand swallowed. “A Trolloc said the Myrddraal wanted to talk to me. I didn’t know what it\\nmeant.”\\nLan’s head jerked up; his eyes were blue stones. “You \\ntalked\\n to a Trolloc?”\\n“Not exactly,” Rand stammered. The Warder’s gaze held him like a trap. “It talked to me. It said\\nit wouldn’t hurt me, that the Myrddraal wanted to talk to me. Then it tried to kill me.” He licked his\\nlips and rubbed his hand along the nobby leather of the sword hilt. In short, choppy sentences he\\nexplained about returning to the farmhouse. “I killed it, instead,” he finished. “By accident, really. It\\njumped at me, and I had the sword in my hand.”\\nLan’s face softened slightly, if rock could be said to soften. “Even so, that is something to speak\\nof, sheepherder. Until last night there were few men south of the Borderlands who could say they had\\nseen a Trolloc, much less killed one.”\\n“And fewer still who have slain a Trolloc alone and unaided,” Moiraine said wearily. “It is\\ndone, Rand. Lan, help me up.”\\nThe Warder sprang to her side, but he was no quicker than Rand darting to the bed. Tam’s skin\\nwas cool to the touch, though his face had a pale, washed-out look, as if he had spent far too long out\\nof the sun. His eyes were still closed, but he drew the deep breaths of normal sleep.\\n“He will be all right now?” Rand asked anxiously.\\n“With rest, yes,” Moiraine said. “A few weeks in bed, and he will be as good as ever.” She\\nwalked unsteadily, despite holding Lan’s arm. He swept her cloak and staff from the chair cushion for\\nher to sit, and she eased herself down with a sigh. With a slow care she rewrapped the \\nangreal\\n and\\nreturned it to her pouch.\\nRand’s shoulders shook; he bit his lip to keep from laughing. At the same time he had to scrub a\\nhand across his eyes to clear away tears. “Thank you.”\\n“In the Age of Legends,” Moiraine went on, “some Aes Sedai could fan life and health to flame\\nif only the smallest spark remained.

It is fortunate that your father is a strong man,\\nboth in body and spirit. As it is, he used up much of his strength in the fight for life, but all that is left\\nnow is for him to recuperate.

As\\nlong as it does not hurt the village, or my friends.”\\nMoiraine raised a hand dismissively. “If you think it is necessary. I would like to talk with you,\\nanyway. You will no doubt leave at the same time we do, and we can speak at length then.”\\n“Leave!” he exclaimed, scrambling to his feet. “Is it really that bad?

We have crops in the ground, and it has to warm enough for the shearing,\\nsoon. I don’t know who started this talk about leaving—one of the Coplins, I’ll bet—but whoever it\\nwas—”\\n“Sheepherder,” Lan broke in, “you talk when you should be listening.”\\nHe blinked at both of them. He had been half babbling, he realized, and he had rambled on while\\nshe tried to talk. While an Aes Sedai tried to talk.

I should have rested, first, I suppose. It is you who will be leaving, Rand. You who must leave,\\nfor the sake of your village.”\\n“Me?” He cleared his throat and tried again. “Me?” It sounded a little better this time. “Why do I\\nhave to go? I don’t understand any of this. I don’t want to go anywhere.”\\nMoiraine looked at Lan, and the Warder unfolded his arms. He looked at Rand from under his\\nleather headband, and Rand had the feeling of being weighed on invisible scales again. “Did you\\nknow,” Lan said suddenly, “that some homes were not attacked?”\\n“Half the village is in ashes,” he protested, but the Warder waved it away.\\n“Some houses were only torched to create confusion. The Trollocs ignored them afterwards, and\\nthe people who fled from them as well, unless they actually got in the way of the true attack. Most of\\nthe people who’ve come in from the outlying farms never saw a hair of a Trolloc, and that only at a\\ndistance. Most never knew there was any trouble until they saw the village.”\\n“I did hear about Darl Coplin,” Rand said slowly. “I suppose it just didn’t sink in.”\\n“Two farms were attacked,” Lan went on. “Yours and one other. Because of Bel Tine everyone\\nwho lived at the second farm was already in the village. Many people were saved because the\\nMyrddraal was ignorant of Two Rivers customs.

The Trollocs did not come to Emond’s Field by\\nhappenstance, and they did not do what they did for the pleasure of killing and burning, however much\\nthat delighted them.

We’re just farmers,\\nshepherds.”\\n“That is a question that has no answer in the Two Rivers,” Moiraine said quietly, “but the\\nanswer is important. Trollocs where they have not been seen in almost two thousand years tells us\\nthat much.”\\n“Lots of stories tell about Trolloc raids,” Rand said stubbornly. “We just never had one here\\nbefore. Warders fight Trollocs all the time.”\\nLan snorted. “Boy, I expect to fight Trollocs along the Great Blight, but not here, nearly six\\nhundred leagues to the south. That was as hot a raid last night as I’d expect to see in Shienar, or any of\\nthe Borderlands.”\\n“In one of you,” Moiraine said, “or all three, there is something the Dark One fears.”\\n“That . . . that’s impossible.” Rand stumbled to the window and stared out at the village, at the\\npeople working among the ruins. “I don’t care what’s happened, that is just impossible.” Something\\non the Green caught his eye. He stared, then realized it was the blackened stump of the Spring Pole. A\\nfine Bel Tine, with a peddler, and a gleeman, and strangers. He shivered, and shook his head\\nviolently. “No. No, I’m a shepherd. The Dark One can’t be interested in me.”\\n“It took a great deal of effort,” Lan said grimly, “to bring so many Trollocs so far without raising\\na hue and cry from the Borderlands to Caemlyn and beyond.

All the farms burned. And Watch\\nHill, and Deven Ride, and Taren Ferry. All ashes and blood. “No,” he said, and felt a wrenching\\ninside as if he had lost his grip on something. “That’s why I have to leave, isn’t it?

Leaving his home and his\\nfather. At least Tam would get better. At least he would be able to hear him say all that on the Quarry\\nRoad had been nonsense. “We could go to Baerlon, I suppose, or even Caemlyn. I’ve heard there are\\nmore people in Caemlyn than in the whole Two Rivers. We’d be safe there.” He tried out a laugh that\\nsounded hollow. “I used to daydream about seeing Caemlyn. I never thought it would come about like\\nthis.”\\nThere was a long silence, then Lan said, “I would not count on Caemlyn for safety. If the\\nMyrddraal want you badly enough, they will find a way. Walls are a poor bar to a Halfman. And you\\nwould be a fool not to believe they want you very badly indeed.”\\nRand thought his spirits had sunk as low as they possibly could, but at that they slid deeper.\\n“There is a place of safety,” Moiraine said softly, and Rand’s ears pricked up to listen. “In Tar\\nValon you would be among Aes Sedai and Warders. Even during the Trolloc Wars the forces of the\\nDark One feared to attack the Shining Walls. The one attempt was their greatest defeat until the very\\nend. And Tar Valon holds all the knowledge we Aes Sedai have gathered since the Time of Madness.\\nSome fragments even date from the Age of Legends. In Tar Valon, if anywhere, you will be able to\\nlearn why the Myrddraal want you. Why the Father of Lies wants you.

Of course, Moiraine had healed Tam—or it looked as if she had,\\nat least—but there were all those stories.

It will be a hard journey tonight even if you are rested.”\\nThe door closed behind them, and Rand stood looking down at Tam—looking at Tam, but seeing\\nnothing. Not until that very minute had he realized that Emond’s Field was a part of him as much as he\\nwas a part of it. He realized it now because he knew that was what he had felt tearing loose. He was\\napart from the village, now. The Shepherd of the Night wanted him. It was impossible—he was only\\na farmer—but the Trollocs had come, and Lan was right about one thing. He could not risk the village\\non the chance Moiraine was wrong. He could not even tell anyone; the Coplins really would make\\ntrouble about something like that. He had to trust an Aes Sedai.\\n“Don’t wake him, now,” Mistress al’Vere said, as the Mayor shut the door behind his wife and\\nhimself.

She set it on the chest\\nagainst the wall, then firmly moved Rand away from the bed.\\n“Mistress Moiraine told me what he needs,” she said softly, “and it does not include you falling\\non top of him from exhaustion. I’ve brought you a bite to eat. Don’t let it get cold, now.”\\n“I wish you wouldn’t call her that,” Bran said peevishly. “Moiraine Sedai is proper. She might\\nget mad.”\\nMistress al’Vere gave him a pat on the cheek. “You just leave me to worry about that. She and I\\nhad a long talk. And keep your voice down. If you wake Tam, you’ll have to answer to me \\nand\\nMoiraine Sedai.” She put an emphasis on Moiraine’s title that made Bran’s insistence seem foolish.\\n“The two of you keep out of my way.” With a fond smile for her husband, she turned to the bed and\\nTam.\\nMaster al’Vere gave Rand a frustrated look. “She’s an Aes Sedai. Half the women in the village\\nact as if she sits in the Women’s Circle, and the rest as if she were a Trolloc. Not a one of them\\nseems to realize you have to be careful around Aes Sedai. The men may keep looking at her\\nsideways, but at least they aren’t doing anything that might provoke her.”\\nCareful, Rand thought. It was not too late to start being careful. “Master al’Vere,” he said\\nslowly, “do you know how many farms were attacked?”\\n“Only two that I’ve heard of so far, including your place.” The Mayor paused, frowning, then\\nshrugged. “It doesn’t seem enough, with what happened here. I should be glad of it, but. . . . Well,\\nwe’ll probably hear of more before the day is out.”\\nRand sighed. No need to ask which farms. “Here in the village, did they. . . . I mean, was there\\nanything to show what they were after?”\\n“After, boy? I don’t know that they were after anything, except maybe killing us all. It was just\\nthe way I said. The dogs barking, and Moiraine Sedai and Lan running through the streets, then\\nsomebody shouted that Master Luhhan’s house and the forge were on fire. Abell Cauthon’s house\\nflared up—odd that; it’s nearly in the middle of the village. Anyway, the next thing the Trollocs were\\nall among us. No, I don’t think they were \\nafter\\n anything.” He gave an abrupt bark of a laugh, and cut it\\nshort with a wary look at his wife. She did not look around from Tam. “To tell the truth,” he went on\\nmore quietly, “they seemed almost as confused as we were.

With mingled relief and joy he started for the walls, for the safety and serenity\\nhe somehow knew he would find behind them.\\nAs he came closer he made out soaring towers, many joined by wondrous walkways that\\nspanned the open air. High bridges arched from both banks of the river to the island city. Even at a\\ndistance he could see lacy stonework on those spans, seemingly too delicate to withstand the swift\\nwaters that rushed beneath them. Beyond those bridges lay safety.

Toward the safety he knew waited there.\\nHe joined the throng streaming across the bridge and into the city through massive gates set in\\ntall, pristine walls. Within was a wonderland where the meanest structure seemed a palace.

He still could not understand the words, but a dozen interweaving harmonies shouted joy and\\nsalvation. Musicians capered through the on-flowing crowd, adding flutes and harps and drums in a\\ndozen sizes to the hymn, and all the songs he had heard before blended in without seam.

Between that and an empty\\nstomach and the night before, it was no wonder he had had nightmares.\\nHis belly rumbled, and he got up stiffly and made his way to the table where Mistress al’Vere\\nhad left the tray. He twitched aside the white napkin. Despite the time he had slept, the beef broth was\\nstill warm, and so was the crusty bread. Mistress al’Vere’s hand was plain; the tray had been\\nreplaced. Once she decided you needed a hot meal, she did not give up till it was inside you.\\nHe gulped down some broth, and it was all he could do to put some meat and cheese between\\ntwo pieces of bread before stuffing it in his mouth. Taking big bites, he went back to the bed.\\nMistress al’Vere had apparently seen to Tam, as well. Tam had been undressed, his clothes now\\nclean and neatly folded on the bedside table, and a blanket was drawn up under his chin. When Rand\\ntouched his father’s forehead, Tam opened his eyes.\\n“There you are, boy. Marin said you were here, but I couldn’t even sit up to see. She said you\\nwere too tired for her to wake just so I could look at you. Even Bran can’t get around her when she\\nhas her mind set.”\\nTam’s voice was weak, but his gaze was clear and steady. \\nThe Aes Sedai was right,\\n Rand\\nthought. With rest he would be as good as ever.\\n“Can I get you something to eat? Mistress al’Vere left a tray.”\\n“She fed me already . . . if you can call it that. Wouldn’t let me have anything but broth.

When Marin told me I was sick, I\\nthought I had been. . . . But you’re all right. That is all that matters. What of the farm?”\\nRand took a deep breath. “The Trollocs killed the sheep. I think they took the cow, too, and the\\nhouse needs a good cleaning.” He managed a weak smile. “We were luckier than some. They burned\\nhalf the village.”\\nHe told Tam everything that had happened, or at least most of it. Tam listened closely, and asked\\nsharp questions, so he found himself having to tell about returning to the farmhouse from the woods,\\nand that brought in the Trolloc he had killed. He had to tell how Nynaeve had said Tam was dying to\\nexplain why the Aes Sedai had tended him instead of the Wisdom. Tam’s eyes widened at that, an\\nAes Sedai in Emond’s Field. But Rand could see no need to go over every step of the journey from\\nthe farm, or his fears, or the Myrddraal on the road. Certainly not his nightmares as he slept by the\\nbed.

Who ever remembered the \\nexact\\n words they heard? He chewed at his lip and\\nscratched his head, and bit by bit he brought it out, as nearly as he could remember. “I can’t think of\\nanything else,” he finished. “Some of it I’m not too sure she didn’t say a little differently, but it’s\\nclose, anyway.”\\n“It’s good enough. It has to be, doesn’t it? You see, lad, Aes Sedai are tricksome. They don’t lie,\\nnot right out, but the truth an Aes Sedai tells you is not always the truth you think it is.

The world outside the Two Rivers is nothing like Emond’s\\nField.”\\nThat was an opening to ask about Tam going outside and all the rest of it, but Rand did not take\\nit. His mouth fell open, instead. “Just like that? I thought you would try to talk me out of it. I thought\\nyou’d have a hundred reasons I should not go.” He realized he had been hoping Tam would have a\\nhundred reasons, and good ones.\\n“Maybe not a hundred,” Tam said with a snort, “but a few did come to mind. Only they don’t\\ncount for much. If Trollocs are after you, you will be safer in Tar Valon than you could ever be here.\\nJust remember to be wary. Aes Sedai do things for their own reasons, and those are not always the\\nreasons you think.”\\n“The gleeman said something like that,” Rand said slowly.\\n“Then he knows what he’s talking about. You listen sharp, think deep, and guard your tongue.\\nThat’s good advice for any dealings beyond the Two Rivers, but most especially with Aes Sedai.\\nAnd with Warders. Tell Lan something, and you’ve as good as told Moiraine.

It was something to do with the Power, a gift to the\\nWarder, or maybe some sort of exchange. The Warders got all sorts of benefits, according to the\\nstories. They healed more quickly than other men, and could go longer without food or water or sleep.\\nSupposedly they could sense Trollocs, if they were close enough, and other creatures of the Dark\\nOne, too, which explained how Lan and Moiraine had tried to warn the village before the attack. As\\nto what the Aes Sedai got out of it, the stories were silent, but he was not about to believe they did not\\nget something.\\n“I’ll be careful,” Rand said. “I just wish I knew why.

Well, if it must be done, best not to delay.

As the enemy generals died, so did she die, and the\\nfires that consumed her consumed the empty city of Manetheren, even the stones of it, down to the\\nliving rock of the mountains. Yet the people had been saved.\\n“Nothing was left of their farms, their villages, or their great city. Some would say there was\\nnothing left for them, nothing but to flee to other lands, where they could begin anew. They did not say\\nso. They had paid such a price in blood and hope for their land as had never been paid before, and\\nnow they were bound to that soil by ties stronger than steel. Other wars would wrack them in years to\\ncome, until at last their corner of the world was forgotten and at last they had forgotten wars and the\\nways of war. Never again did Manetheren rise. Its soaring spires and splashing fountains became as a\\ndream that slowly faded from the minds of its people. But they, and their children, and their children’s\\nchildren, held the land that was theirs. They held it when the long centuries had washed the why of it\\nfrom their memories. They held it until, today, there is you. Weep for Manetheren. Weep for what is\\nlost forever.”\\nThe fires on Moiraine’s staff winked out, and she lowered it to her side as if it weighed a\\nhundred pounds.

And for me,\\nyou can stay in Emond’s Field as long as you like.”\\nWith a quick duck of his head, almost a bow, he pushed back through the crowd. Others began to\\nmutter then, offering shamefaced penitence before they, too, slipped away one by one.

Why would anybody hide—”\\n“Care and a long life go together, blacksmith.” The Warder ran a quick eye around the shadowed\\nstable and the deeper shadows of the hayloft above, then shook his head. “No time,” he muttered, half\\nto himself. “Hurry, she says.”\\nAs if to suit his words, he strode quickly to where the five horses stood tethered, bridled and\\nsaddled at the back of the pool of light. Two were the black stallion and white mare that Rand had\\nseen before. The others, if not quite so tall or so sleek, certainly appeared to be among the best the\\nTwo Rivers had to offer.

The Warder apparently took no\\nnotice. “Or at least a merchant’s guard,” Mat went on with a grin that seemed only a little forced. He\\nhefted his bow. “An honest man’s weapon isn’t good enough for him.”\\nRand thought about flourishing the sword, but Lan being there stopped him. The Warder was not\\neven looking in his direction, but he was sure the man was aware of everything that went on around\\nhim. Instead he said with exaggerated casualness, “It might be useful,” as if wearing a sword were\\nnothing out of the ordinary.\\nPerrin moved, trying to hide something under his cloak. Rand glimpsed a wide leather belt\\nencircling the apprentice blacksmith’s waist, with the handle of an axe thrust through a loop on the\\nbelt.\\n“What do you have there?” he asked.\\n“Merchant’s guard, indeed,” Mat hooted.\\nThe shaggy-haired youth gave Mat a frown that suggested he had already had more than his fair\\nshare of joking, then sighed heavily and tossed back his cloak to uncover the axe.

It’s just as well one of us knows how to use a real weapon.”\\n“That bow is a real weapon,” Lan said suddenly. He propped an arm across the saddle of his\\ntall black and regarded them gravely. “So are the slings I’ve seen you village boys with. Just because\\nyou never used them for anything but hunting rabbits or chasing a wolf away from the sheep makes no\\ndifference. Anything can be a weapon, if the man or woman who holds it has the nerve and will to\\nmake it so.

Perrin grimaced and pulled his cloak back over the axe. Mat stared at his feet and\\nstirred the straw on the stable floor with his toe. The Warder grunted and went back to his checking,\\nand the silence lengthened.\\n“It isn’t much like the stories,” Mat said, finally.\\n“I don’t know,” Perrin said sourly. “Trollocs, a Warder, an Aes Sedai. What more could you\\nask?”\\n“Aes Sedai,” Mat whispered, sounding as if he were suddenly cold.\\n“Do you believe her, Rand?” Perrin asked. “I mean, what would Trollocs want with us?”\\nAs one, they glanced at the Warder. Lan appeared absorbed in the white mare’s saddle girth, but\\nthe three of them moved back toward the stable door, away from Lan. Even so, they huddled together\\nand spoke softly.\\nRand shook his head. “I don’t know, but she had it right about our farms being the only ones\\nattacked. And they attacked Master Luhhan’s house and the forge first, here in the village. I asked the\\nMayor. It’s as easy to believe they are after us as anything else I can think of.” Suddenly he realized\\nthey were both staring at him.\\n“You asked the Mayor?” Mat said incredulously. “She said not to tell anybody.”\\n“I didn’t tell him why I was asking,” Rand protested. “Do you mean you didn’t talk to anybody at\\nall?

Rand, my mother\\nthinks Tar Valon is the next thing to Shayol Ghul.” He gave a little laugh to show he did not share her\\nopinion. It was not very convincing. “She’d try to lock me in the cellar if she believed I was even\\nthinking of going there.”\\n“Master Luhhan is stubborn as stone,” Perrin added, “and Mistress Luhhan is worse.

Lan’s sword\\nleft its sheath this time, and he did not put it back as he stared up at the gleeman.\\nThom tossed down a blanketroll, then slung his cased flute and harp across his back and\\nshouldered bulging saddlebags. “This village has no use for me, now, while on the other hand, I have\\nnever performed in Tar Valon.

But he knew\\nhe could not dissuade Egwene; the only thing left was to help. “Bela may not be as fast as the others,\\nbut she’s strong. I ride her sometimes. She can keep up.”\\nLan looked into Bela’s stall, muttering under his breath. “She might be a little better than the\\nothers,” he said finally. “I don’t suppose there is any other choice.”\\n“Then she will have to do,” Moiraine said. “Rand, find a saddle for Bela. Quickly, now! We\\nhave tarried too long already.”\\nRand hurriedly chose a saddle and blanket in the tack room, then fetched Bela from her stall. The\\nmare looked back at him in sleepy surprise when he put the saddle on her back. When he rode her, it\\nwas barebacked; she was not used to a saddle. He made soothing noises while he tightened the girth\\nstrap, and she accepted the oddity with no more than a shake of her mane.\\nTaking Egwene’s bundle from her, he tied it on behind the saddle while she mounted and\\nadjusted her skirts. They were not divided for riding astride, so her wool stockings were bared to the\\nknee. She wore the same soft leather shoes as all the other village girls. They were not at all suited\\nfor journeying to Watch Hill, much less Tar Valon.\\n“I still think you shouldn’t come,” he said. “I wasn’t making it up about the Trollocs. But I\\npromise I will take care of you.”\\n“Perhaps I’ll take care of you,” she replied lightly.

He\\nscrambled into the saddle, though not without difficulty as the gray tossed his head and pranced\\nsideways as Rand put his foot in the stirrup, and his scabbard caught in his legs. It was not chance that\\nhis friends had not chosen Cloud. Master Thane often raced the spirited gray against merchants’\\nhorses, and Rand had never known him to lose, but he had never known Cloud to give anyone an easy\\nride, either.

Getting out of the village without being seen was going to be no easy task, Rand decided as he\\nneared the gate. At least, without being seen by villagers.

So close to the Winespring itself the cold, swift water,\\ngleaming as it swirled around the horses’ legs, was deep enough to lap against the soles of the riders’\\nboots.\\nClimbing out on the far bank, the line of horses wound its way under the Warder’s deft direction,\\nkeeping away from any of the village houses.

The wings that carried this creature might\\nhave the same shape, but they moved with the slow, powerful sweep of a bird of prey. And it was\\nhunting.

For the rest, murk surrounded them, and only a\\nsolitary night-bird’s cry, lonely and mournful, disturbed the steady pounding of hooves.\\nAbruptly Lan slowed, then brought the file of horses to a stop. Rand was not sure how long they\\nhad been moving, but a soft ache filled his legs from gripping the saddle. Ahead of them in the night,\\nlights sparkled, as if a tall swarm of fireflies held one place among the trees.\\nRand frowned at the lights in puzzlement, then suddenly gasped with surprise. The fireflies were\\nwindows, the windows of houses covering the sides and top of a hill. It was Watch Hill. He could\\nhardly believe they had come so far. They had probably made the journey as fast as it had ever been\\ntraveled. Following Lan’s example, Rand and Thom Merrilin dismounted. Cloud stood head down,\\nsides heaving. Lather, almost indistinguishable from the horse’s smoky sides, flecked the gray’s neck\\nand shoulders. Rand thought that Cloud would not be carrying anyone further that night.\\n“Much as I would like to put all these villages behind me,” Thom announced, “a few hours rest\\nwould not go amiss right now. Surely we have enough of a lead to allow that?”\\nRand stretched, knuckling the small of his back. “If we’re stopping the rest of the night in Watch\\nHill, we may as well go on up.”\\nA vagrant gust of wind brought a fragment of song from the village, and smells of cooking that\\nmade his mouth water. They were still celebrating in Watch Hill. There had been no Trollocs to\\ndisturb their Bel Tine. He looked for Egwene. She was leaning against Bela, slumped with\\nweariness. The others were climbing down as well, with many a sigh and much stretching of aching\\nmuscles. Only the Warder and the Aes Sedai showed no visible sign of fatigue.\\n“I could do with some singing,” Mat put in tiredly. “And maybe a hot mutton pie at the White\\nBoar.” Pausing, he added, “I’ve never been further than Watch Hill. The White Boar’s not nearly as\\ngood as the Winespring Inn.”\\n“The White Boar isn’t so bad,” Perrin said. “A mutton pie for me, too. And lots of hot tea to take\\nthe chill off my bones.”\\n“We cannot stop until we are across the Taren,” Lan said sharply. “Not for more than a few\\nminutes.”\\n“But the horses,” Rand protested. “We’ll run them to death if we try to go any further tonight.\\nMoiraine Sedai, surely you—”\\nHe had vaguely noticed her moving among the horses, but he had not paid any real attention to\\nwhat she did. Now she brushed past him to lay her hands on Cloud’s neck. Rand fell silent. Suddenly\\nthe horse tossed his head with a soft whicker, nearly pulling the reins from Rand’s hands. The gray\\ndanced a step sideways, as restive as if he had spent a week in a stable. Without a word Moiraine\\nwent to Bela.\\n“I did not know she could do that,” Rand said softly to Lan, his cheeks hot.\\n“You, of all people, should have suspected it,” the Warder replied. “You watched her with your\\nfather. She will wash all the fatigue away. First from the horses, then from the rest of you.”\\n“The rest of us. Not you?”\\n“Not me, sheepherder. I don’t need it, not yet. And not her. What she can do for others, she\\ncannot do for herself. Only one of us will ride tired. You had better hope she does not grow too tired\\nbefore we reach Tar Valon.”\\n“Too tired for what?” Rand asked the Warder.\\n“You were right about your Bela, Rand,” Moiraine said from where she stood by the mare. “She\\nhas a good heart, and as much stubbornness as the rest of you Two Rivers folk.

The night deepened in the shadow that swept over them. With panicked cries the\\nhorses reared wildly.\\nThe wind of the Draghkar’s wings beat at Rand with a feel like the touch of slime, like chittering\\nin the dank dimness of a nightmare. He had no time even to feel the fear of it, for Cloud exploded into\\nthe air with a scream of his own, twisting desperately as if attempting to shake off some clinging\\nthing. Rand, hanging onto the reins, was jerked off his feet and dragged across the ground, Cloud\\nscreaming as though the big gray felt wolves tearing at his hocks.\\nSomehow he maintained his grip on the reins; using the other hand as much as his legs he\\nscrambled onto his feet, taking leaping, staggering steps to keep from being pulled down again. His\\nbreath came in ragged pants of desperation. He could not let Cloud get away. He threw out a frantic\\nhand, barely catching the bridle. Cloud reared, lifting him into the air; Rand clung helplessly, hoping\\nagainst hope that the horse would quieten.\\nThe shock of landing jarred Rand to his teeth, but suddenly the gray was still, nostrils flaring and\\neyes rolling, stiff-legged and trembling. Rand was trembling as well, and all but hanging from the\\nbridle. \\nThat jolt must have shaken the fool animal, too,\\n he thought. He took three or four deep, shaky\\nbreaths. Only then could he look around and see what had happened to the others.\\nChaos reigned among the party. They clutched reins against jerking heads, trying with little\\nsuccess to calm the rearing horses that dragged them about in a milling mass. Only two seemingly had\\nno trouble at all with their mounts. Moiraine sat straight in her saddle, the white mare stepping\\ndelicately away from the confusion as if nothing at all out of the ordinary had happened. On foot, Lan\\nscanned the sky, sword in one hand and reins in the other; the sleek black stallion stood quietly beside\\nhim.\\nSounds of merrymaking no longer came from Watch Hill. Those in the village must have heard\\nthe cry, too. Rand knew they would listen awhile, and perhaps watch for what had caused it, then\\nreturn to their jollity. They would soon forget the incident, its memory submerged by song and food\\nand dance and fun. Perhaps when they heard the news of what had happened in Emond’s Field some\\nwould remember, and wonder. A fiddle began to play, and after a moment a flute joined in. The\\nvillage was resuming its celebration.\\n“Mount!” Lan commanded curtly. Sheathing his sword, he leaped onto the stallion. “The\\nDraghkar would not have showed itself unless it had already reported our whereabouts to the\\nMyrddraal.” Another strident shriek drifted down from far above, fainter but no less harsh. The music\\nfrom Watch Hill silenced raggedly once more. “It tracks us now, marking us for the Halfman. He\\nwon’t be far.”\\nThe horses, fresh now as well as fear-struck, pranced and backed away from those trying to\\nmount. A cursing Thom Merrilin was the first into his saddle, but the others were up soon after. All\\nbut one.\\n“Hurry, Rand!” Egwene shouted. The Draghkar gave shrill voice once more, and Bela ran a few\\nsteps before she could rein the mare in. “Hurry!”\\nWith a start Rand realized that instead of trying to mount Cloud he had been standing there\\nstaring at the sky in a vain attempt to locate the source of those vile shrieks. More, all unaware, he\\nhad drawn Tam’s sword as if to fight the flying thing.\\nHis face reddened, making him glad for the night to hide him.

The rest seemed too absorbed with keeping their horses under control to pay him any\\nmind.

There\\nwould be time enough to worry about it then.\\nAs soon as he was in the saddle they were all off at a gallop again, up the road and by the dome-\\nlike hill. Dogs barked in the village; their passage was not entirely unnoticed. \\nOr maybe the dogs\\nsmelled Trollocs,\\n Rand thought. The barking and the village lights alike vanished quickly behind\\nthem.\\nThey galloped in a knot, horses all but jostling together as they ran. Lan ordered them to spread\\nout again, but no one wanted to be even a little alone in the night. A scream came from high overhead.\\nThe Warder gave up and let them run clustered.\\nRand was close behind Moiraine and Lan, the gray straining in an effort to force himself\\nbetween the Warder’s black and the Aes Sedai’s trim mare.

His mouth\\ndropped open in surprise, until a swallowed biteme set him off into a fit of coughing.\\nLan must have asked a question, for Moiraine suddenly shouted over the wind and the pounding\\nof hooves. “I cannot! Most especially not from the back of a galloping horse. They are not easily\\nkilled, even when they can be seen. We must run, and hope.”\\nThey galloped through a tatter of fog, thin and no higher than the horses’ knees. Cloud sped\\nthrough it in two strides, and Rand blinked, wondering if he had imagined it. Surely the night was too\\ncold for fog. Another patch of ragged gray whisked by them to one side, larger than the first. It had\\nbeen growing, as if the mist oozed from the ground. Above them, the Draghkar screamed in rage. Fog\\nenveloped the riders for a brief moment and was gone, came again and vanished behind. The icy mist\\nleft a chill dampness on Rand’s face and hands. Then a wall of pale gray loomed before them, and\\nthey were suddenly enshrouded. The thickness of it muffled the sound of their hooves to dullness, and\\nthe cries from overhead seemed to come through a wall.

The\\nlanding groaned, and with a thunderous crack of snapping wood, the twin glows lurched, then began\\nto revolve. Egwene cried out wordlessly, and Thom cursed.\\n“It's loose!” Hightower screamed. Grabbing his haulers, he pushed them toward the end of the\\nlanding. “The ferry's loose, you fools! Get it! Get it!”\\nThe haulers stumbled a few steps under Hightower's shoves, then stopped. The faint lights on the\\nferry spun faster, then faster still. The fog above them swirled, sucked into a spiral. The landing\\ntrembled. The cracking and splintering of wood filled the air as the ferry began breaking apart.\\n“Whirl pool,” one of the haulers said, his voice filled with awe.\\n“No whirl pools on the Taren.” Hightower sounded empty. “Never been a whirl pool.…”\\n“An unfortunate occurrence.” Moiraine's voice was hollow in the fog that made her a shadow as\\nshe turned from the river.\\n“Unfortunate,” Lan agreed in a flat tone. “It seems you'll be carrying no one else across the river\\nfor a time. An ill thing that you lost your craft in our service.” He delved again into his purse, ready in\\nhis hand. “This should repay you.”\\nFor a moment Hightower stared at the gold, glinting in Lan's hand in the torchlight, then his\\nshoulders hunched and his eyes darted to the others he had carried across. Made indistinct by the fog,\\nthe Emond's Fielders stood silently. With a frightened, inarticulate cry, the ferryman snatched the\\ncoins from Lan, whirled, and ran into the mist. His haulers were only half a step behind him, their\\ntorches quickly swallowed as they vanished upriver.\"),\n",

Hurriedly he scrambled up the gently\\nsloping bank.\\nIn the space of three paces the heavy mist faded away to nothing. He stopped dead and stared\\nback. Along a line running down the shore thick gray hung on one side, on the other shone a clear\\nnight sky, still dark though the sharpness of the moon hinted at dawn not far off.\\nThe Warder and the Aes Sedai stood conferring beside their horses a short distance beyond the\\nborder of the fog. The others huddled a little apart; even in the moonlit darkness their nervousness\\nwas palpable. All eyes were on Lan and Moiraine, and all but Egwene were leaning back as if torn\\nbetween losing the pair and getting too close. Rand trotted the last few spans to Egwene's side,\\nleading Cloud, and she grinned at him. He did not think the shine in her eyes was all from moonlight.\\n“It follows the river as if drawn with a pen,” Moiraine was saying in satisfied tones. “There are\\nnot ten women in Tar Valon who could do that unaided. Not to mention from the back of a galloping\\nhorse.”\\n“I don't mean to complain, Moiraine Sedai,” Thom said, sounding oddly diffident for him, “but\\nwould it not have been better to cover us a little further? Say to Baerlon? If that Draghkar looks on\\nthis side of the river, we'll lose everything we have gained.”\\n“Draghkar are not very smart, Master Merrilin,” the Aes Sedai said dryly. “Fearsome and\\ndeadly dangerous, and with sharp eyes, but little intelligence. It will tell the Myrddraal that this side\\nof the river is clear, but the river itself is cloaked for miles in both directions. The Myrddraal will\\nknow the extra effort that cost me. He will have to consider that we may be escaping down the river,\\nand that will slow him. He will have to divide his efforts. The fog should hold long enough that he\\nwill never be sure that we did not travel at least partway by boat. I could have extended the fog a\\nlittle way toward Baerlon, instead, but then the Draghkar could search the river in a matter of hours,\\nand the Myrddraal would know exactly where we were headed.”\\nThom made a puffing sound and shook his head. “I apologize, Aes Sedai. I hope I did not\\noffend.”\\n“Ah, Moi… ah, Aes Sedai.” Mat stopped to swallow audibly. “The ferry… ah… did you… I\\nmean… I don't understand why.…” He trailed off weakly, and there was a silence so deep that the\\nloudest sound Rand heard was his own breathing.\\nFinally Moiraine spoke, and her voice filled the empty silence with sharpness. “You all want\\nexplanations, but if I explained my every action to you, I would have no time for anything else.” In the\\nmoonlight, the Aes Sedai seemed taller, somehow, almost looming over them. “Know this. I intend to\\nsee you safely in Tar Valon. That is the one thing you need to know.”\\n“If we keep standing here,” Lan put in, “the Draghkar will not need to search the river. If I\\nremember correctly.…” He led his horse on up the riverbank.\\nAs if the Warder's movement had loosened something in his chest, Rand drew a deep breath. He\\nheard others doing the same, even Thom, and remembered an old saying. Better to spit in a wolf's eye\\nthan to cross an Aes Sedai. Yet the tension had lessened. Moiraine was not looming over anyone; she\\nbarely reached his chest.\\n“I don't suppose we could rest a bit,” Perrin said hopefully, ending with a yawn.

Bare branches thickened the\\nshadows. A good hundred spans from the Taren they came to a dark mound beside a clearing. Here a\\nlong-ago flood had undermined and toppled an entire stand of leatherleafs, washing them together into\\na great, thick tangle, an apparently solid mass of trunks and branches and roots.

The light of the torch vanished.\\nLan had included feedbags and a small quantity of oats in the supplies, but he stopped the others\\nfrom unsaddling their horses. Instead he produced the hobbles he had also packed. “They would rest\\neasier without the saddles, but if we must leave quickly, there may be no time to replace them.”\\n“They don't look to me like they need any rest,” Perrin said as he attempted to slip a feedbag\\nover his mount's muzzle. The horse tossed its head before allowing him to put the straps in place.\\nRand was having difficulties with Cloud, too, taking three tries before he could get the canvas bag\\nover the gray's nose.\\n“They do,” Lan told them. He straightened from hobbling his stallion. “Oh, they can still run.\\nThey will run at their fastest, if we let them, right up to the second they drop dead from exhaustion\\nthey never even felt. I would rather Moiraine Sedai had not had to do what she did, but it was\\nnecessary.” He patted the stallion's neck, and the horse bobbed his head as if acknowledging the\\nWarder's touch. “We must go slowly with them for the next few days, until they recover. More slowly\\nthan I would like. But with luck it will be enough.”\\n“Is that… ?” Mat swallowed audibly. “Is that what she meant? About our tiredness?”\\nRand patted Cloud's neck and stared at nothing. Despite what she had done for Tam, he had no\\ndesire for the Aes Sedai to use the Power on him. \\nLight, she as much as admitted sinking the ferry.\\n“Something like it.” Lan chuckled wryly. “But you will not have to worry about running yourself\\nto death. Not unless things get a lot worse than they are. Just think of it as an extra night's sleep.”\\nThe shrill scream of the Draghkar suddenly echoed from above the fog-covered river. Even the\\nhorses froze. Again it came, closer now, and again, piercing Rand's skull like needles. Then the cries\\nwere fading, until they had faded away entirely.\\n“Luck,” Lan breathed. “It searches the river for us.” He gave a quick shrug and abruptly sounded\\nmatter-of-fact. “Let's get inside. I could do with some hot tea and something to fill my belly.”\\nRand was the first to crawl on hands and knees through the opening in the tangle of trees and\\ndown a short tunnel. At the end of it, he stopped, still crouching. Ahead was an irregularly shaped\\nspace, a woody cave easily large enough to hold them all. The roof of tree trunks and branches came\\ntoo low to allow any but the women to stand. Smoke from a small fire on a bed of river stones drifted\"),\n",

Moiraine and Egwene, their cloaks thrown aside, sat\\ncross-legged, facing one another beside the fire.\\n“The One Power,” Moiraine was saying, “comes from the True Source, the driving force of\\nCreation, the force the Creator made to turn the Wheel of Time.” She put her hands together in front of\\nher and pushed them against each other. “\\nSaidin,\\n the male half of the True Source, and \\nsaidar,\\n the\\nfemale half, work against each other and at the same time together to provide that force. \\nSaidin\\n”—she\\nlifted one hand, then let it drop—“is fouled by the touch of the Dark One, like water with a thin slick\\nof rancid oil floating on top. The water is still pure, but it cannot be touched without touching the\\nfoulness. Only \\nsaidar\\n is still safe to be used.” Egwene's back was to Rand. He could not see her face,\\nbut she was leaning forward eagerly.\\nMat poked Rand from behind and muttered something, and he moved on into the tree cavern.\\nMoiraine and Egwene ignored his entry. The other men crowded in behind him, tossing off damp\\ncloaks, settling around the fire, and holding hands out to the warmth. Lan, the last to enter, pulled\\nwaterbags and leather sacks from a nook in the wall, took out a kettle, and began to prepare tea. He\\npaid no attention to what the women were saying, but Rand's friends began to stop toasting their hands\\nand stare openly. Thom pretended that all of his interest was engaged in loading his thickly carved\\npipe, but the way he leaned toward the women gave him away. Moiraine and Egwene acted as if they\\nwere alone.\\n“No,” Moiraine said in answer to a question Rand had missed, “the True Source cannot be used\\nup, any more than the river can be used up by the wheel of a mill. The Source is the river; the Aes\\nSedai, the waterwheel.”\\n“And you really think I can learn?” Egwene asked. Her face shone with eagerness. Rand had\\nnever seen her look so beautiful, or so far away from him. “I can become an Aes Sedai?”\\nRand jumped up, cracking his head against the low roof of logs. Thom Merrilin grabbed his arm,\\nyanking him back down.\\n“Don't be a fool,” the gleeman murmured. He eyed the women—neither seemed to have noticed\\n—and the look he gave Rand was sympathetic. “It's beyond you now, boy.”\\n“Child,” Moiraine said gently, “only a very few can learn to touch the True Source and use the\\nOne Power. Some of those can learn to a greater degree, some to a lesser. You are one of the bare\\nhandful for whom there is no need to learn. At least, touching the Source will come to you whether\\nyou want it or not. Without the teaching you can receive in Tar Valon, though, you will never learn to\\nchannel it fully, and you may not survive. Men who have the ability to touch \\nsaidin\\n born in them die,\\nof course, if the Red Ajah does not find them and gentle them.…”\\nThom growled deep in his throat, and Rand shifted uncomfortably. Men like those of whom the\\nAes Sedai spoke were rare—he had only heard of three in his whole life, and thank the Light never in\\nthe Two Rivers—but the damage they did before the Aes Sedai found them was always bad enough\\nfor the news to carry, like the news of wars, or earthquakes that destroyed cities. He had never really\\nunderstood what the Ajahs did. According to the stories they were societies among the Aes Sedai that\\nseemed to plot and squabble among themselves more than anything else, but the stories were clear on\\none point. The Red Ajah held its prime duty to be the prevention of another Breaking of the World,\\nand they did it by hunting down every man who even dreamed of wielding the One Power. Mat and\\nPerrin looked as if they suddenly wished they were back home in their beds.\\n“... but some of the women die, too. It is hard to learn without a guide.

I knew you for what you were the moment I saw you. No Aes Sedai can stand in\\nthe presence of a woman who can channel, or who is close to her change, and not feel it.” She\\nrummaged in the pouch at her belt and produced the small blue gem on a gold chain that she had\\nearlier worn in her hair. “You are very close to your change, your first touching. It will be better if I\\nguide you through it. That way you will avoid the… unpleasant effects that come to those who must\\nfind their own way.”\\nEgwene's eyes widened as she looked at the stone, and she wet her lips repeatedly. “Is… does\\nthat have the Power?”\\n“Of course not,” Moiraine snapped. “\\nThings\\n do not have the Power, child.

Tiredness drained out of him like water running downhill; aches and soreness ebbed to dim\\nmemories and vanished. He stared at her with his mouth hanging open. She only smiled and withdrew\\nher hands.\\n“It is done,” she said, and as she stood with a weary sigh he was reminded that she could not do\\nthe same for herself. Indeed, she only drank a little tea, refusing the bread and cheese Lan tried to\\npress on her, before curling up beside the fire. She seemed to fall asleep the instant she wrapped her\\ncloak around her.\\nThe others, all save Lan, were dropping asleep wherever they could find a space to stretch out,\\nbut Rand could not imagine why.

Even so, he allowed them only a short stay in the snug cave of trees.

He tried not to think on what that might mean. Even rested, he was full enough\\nof doubts without searching out more. Hunching in his saddle he began a waking dream of tending the\\nsheep alongside Tam in a pasture with deep, lush grass and larks singing of a spring morning. And a\\ntrip into Emond’s Field, and Bel Tine the way it had been, dancing on the Green with never a care\\nbeyond whether he might stumble in the steps. He managed to lose himself in it for a long time.\\nThe journey to Baerlon took almost a week. Lan muttered about the laggardness of their travel,\\nbut it was he who set the pace and forced the rest to keep it. With himself and his stallion, Mandarb—\\nhe said it meant “Blade” in the Old Tongue—he was not so sparing. The Warder covered twice as\\nmuch ground as they did, galloping ahead, his color-shifting cloak swirling in the wind, to scout what\\nlay before them, or dropping behind to examine their backtrail. Any others who tried to move at more\\nthan a walk, though, got cutting words on taking care of their animals, biting words on how well they\\nwould do afoot if the Trollocs did appear. Not even Moiraine was proof against his tongue if she let\\nthe white mare pick up her step. Aldieb, the mare was called; in the Old Tongue, “Westwind,” the\\nwind that brought the spring rains.\\nThe Warder’s scouting never turned up any sign of pursuit, or ambush. He spoke only to\\nMoiraine of what he saw, and that quietly, so it could not be overheard, and the Aes Sedai informed\\nthe rest of them of what she thought they needed to know. In the beginning, Rand looked over his\\nshoulder as much as he did ahead. He was not the only one. Perrin fingered his axe often, and Mat\\nrode with an arrow nocked to his bow, in the beginning. But the land behind remained empty of\\nTrollocs or figures in black cloaks, the sky remained empty of Draghkar. Slowly, Rand began to think\\nperhaps they really had escaped.\\nNo very great cover was to be had, even in the thickest parts of the woods. Winter clung as hard\\nnorth of the Taren as it did in the Two Rivers. Stands of pine or fir or leatherleaf, and here and there\\na few spicewoods or laurels, dotted a forest of otherwise bare, gray branches. Not even the elders\\nshowed a leaf. Only scattered green sprigs of new growth stood out against brown meadows beaten\\nflat by the winter’s snows. Here, too, much of what did grow was stinging nettles and coarse thistle\\nand stinkweed. On the bare dirt of the forest floor some of the last snow still hung on, in shady\\npatches and in drifts beneath the low branches of evergreens. Everyone kept their cloaks drawn well\\nabout them, for the thin sunlight had no warmth to it and the night cold pierced deep. No more birds\\nflew here than in the Two Rivers, not even ravens.\\nThere was nothing leisurely about the slowness of their movement. The North Road—Rand\\ncontinued to think of it that way, though he suspected it might have a different name here, north of the\\nTaren—still ran almost due north, but at Lan’s insistence their path snaked this way and that through\\nthe forest as often as it ran along the hard-packed dirt road. A village, or a farm, or any sign of men or\\ncivilization sent them circling for miles to avoid it, though there were few enough of any of those. The\\nwhole first day Rand saw no evidence aside from the road that men had ever been in that woods. It'),\n",

People moved around the farmyard, as yet unaware of the travelers.\\n“Of course it is,” Mat said. “We’re just not close enough to see.”\\n“I tell you, it’s no different,” Perrin insisted.\\n“It must be. We’re north of the Taren, after all.”\\n“Quiet, you two,” Lan growled. “We don’t want to be seen, remember? This way.” He turned\\nwest, to circle the farm through the trees.\\nLooking back, Rand thought Perrin was right. The farm looked much the same as any around\\nEmond’s Field. There was a small boy toting water from the well, and older boys tending sheep\\nbehind a rail fence. It even had a curing shed, for tabac. But Mat was right, too. \\nWe’re north of the\\nTaren. It must be different.\\nAlways they halted while light still clung to the sky, to choose a spot sloped for drainage and\\nsheltered from the wind that seldom died completely, only changed direction. Their fire was always\\nsmall and hidden from only a few yards off, and once tea was brewed, the flames were doused and\\nthe coals buried.\\nAt their first stop, before the sun sank, Lan began teaching the boys what to do with the weapons\\nthey carried. He started with the bow. After watching Mat put three arrows into a knot the size of a\\nman’s head, on the fissured trunk of a dead leatherleaf, at a hundred paces, he told the others to take\\ntheir turns. Perrin duplicated Mat’s feat, and Rand, summoning the flame and the void, the empty calm\\nthat let the bow become a part of him, or him of it, clustered his three where the points almost touched\\none another. Mat gave him a congratulatory clap on the shoulder.\\n“Now if you all had bows,” the Warder said dryly when they started grinning, “and if the\\nTrollocs agreed not to come so close you couldn’t use them. . . .” The grins faded abruptly. “Let me\\nsee what I can teach you in case they do come that close.”\\nHe showed Perrin a bit of how to use that great-bladed axe; raising an axe to someone, or\\nsomething, that had a weapon was not at all like chopping wood or flailing around in pretend. Setting\\nthe big apprentice blacksmith to a series of exercises, block, parry, and strike, he did the same for\\nRand and his sword. Not the wild leaping about and slashing that Rand had in mind whenever he\\nthought about using it, but smooth motions, one flowing into another, almost a dance.\\n“Moving the blade is not enough,” Lan said, “though some think it is. The mind is part of it, most\\nof it. Blank your mind, sheepherder. Empty it of hate or fear, of everything. Burn them away. You\\nothers listen to this, too. You can use it with the axe or the bow, with a spear, or a quarterstaff, or\\neven your bare hands.”\\nRand stared at him. “The flame and the void,” he said wonderingly. “That’s what you mean, isn’t\\nit? My father taught me about that.”\\nThe Warder gave him an unreadable look in return. “Hold the sword as I showed you,\\nsheepherder. I cannot make a mud-footed villager into a blademaster in an hour, but perhaps I can\\nkeep you from slicing off your own foot.”\\nRand sighed and held the sword upright before him in both hands. Moiraine watched without\\nexpression, but the next evening she told Lan to continue the lessons.\\nThe meal at evening was always the same as at midday and breakfast, flatbread and cheese and'),\n",

Rand watched her\\nfrom the corner of his eye as he made up his blanketroll. Every night when the fire was doused,\\neveryone took to their blankets except for Egwene and the Aes Sedai. The two women always went\\naside from the others and talked for an hour or two, returning when the others were asleep. Egwene\\ncombed her hair out—one hundred strokes; he counted—while he was saddling Cloud, tying his\\nsaddlebags and blanket behind the saddle. Then she tucked the comb away, swept her loose hair over\\nher shoulder, and pulled up the hood of her cloak.\\nStartled, he asked, “What are you doing?” She gave him a sidelong look without answering. It\\nwas the first time he had spoken to her in two days, he realized, since the night in the log shelter on\\nthe bank of the Taren, but he did not let that stop him. “All your life you’ve waited to wear your hair\\nin a braid, and now you’re giving it up? Why? Because she doesn’t braid hers?”\\n“Aes Sedai don’t braid their hair,” she said simply. “At least, not unless they want to.”\\n“You aren’t an Aes Sedai. You’re Egwene al’Vere from Emond’s Field, and the Women’s\\nCircle would have a fit if they could see you now.”\\n“Women’s Circle business is none of yours, Rand al’Thor. And I \\nwill\\n be an Aes Sedai. Just as\\nsoon as I reach Tar Valon.”\\nHe snorted. “As soon as you reach Tar Valon. Why? Light, tell me that. You’re no Darkfriend.”\\n“Do you think Moiraine Sedai is a Darkfriend? Do you?” She squared around to face him with\\nher fists clenched, and he almost thought she was going to hit him. “After she saved the village? After\\nshe saved your father?”\\n“I don’t know what she is, but whatever she is, it doesn’t say anything about the rest of them. The\\nstories—”\\n“Grow up, Rand!

Abruptly Rand wondered how long she had been standing there.\\n“The lads were just—” Thom began, but Moiraine spoke right over the top of him.\\n“A few days respite, and you are ready to give up.” Her calm, level voice contrasted sharply\\nwith her eyes. “A day or two of quiet, and already you have forgotten Winternight.”\\n“We haven’t forgotten,” Perrin said. “It’s just—” Still not raising her voice, the Aes Sedai\\ntreated him as she had the gleeman.\\n“Is that the way you all feel? You are all eager to run off to Illian and forget about Trollocs, and\\nHalfmen, and Draghkar?” She ran her eyes over them—that stony glint playing against the everyday\\ntone of voice made Rand uneasy—but she gave no one a chance to speak. “The Dark One is after you\\nthree, one or all, and if I let you go running off wherever you want to go, he will take you.

His color-changing cloak made a large bulge in one of his\\nsaddlebags. “We do not go by our own names here,” Moiraine continued. “Here I am known as Alys,\\nand Lan is Andra. Remember that. Good. Let us be within the walls before night catches us. The gates\\nof Baerlon are closed from sundown to sunrise.”\\nLan led the way down the hill and through the woods toward the log wall.

They were closed\\ntight, even if the sun was not down yet.\\nLan rode close to the wall and gave a tug to a frayed rope hanging down beside the gates. A bell\\nclanged on the other side of the wall.

Moiraine and Lan were\\nalready on foot, speaking to the wrinkle-faced gatekeeper, so Rand dismounted, too.\\nThe little man, in a much-mended cloak and coat, held his cloth cap crumpled in one hand and\\nducked his head whenever he spoke. He peered at those dismounting behind Lan and Moiraine, and\\nshook his head. “Downcountry folk.” He grinned. “Why, Mistress Alys, you taken up collecting\\ndowncountry folk with hay in their hair?” His look took in Thom Merrilin, then. “You ain’t a\\nsheepfarmer.

No need for that. You give me plenty when you went out.\\nPlenty.” Just the same, Avin made the coin disappear as deftly as if he were a gleeman, too. “I ain’t\\ntold nobody, and I won’t, neither.

He wondered if this was more trouble already.\\n“The Children are in Baerlon?” Lan demanded.\\n“They surely are.” The gatekeeper bobbed his head. “Came the same day you left, as I recall.\\nAin’t nobody here likes them at all. Most don’t let on, of course.”\\n“Have they said why they are here?” Moiraine asked intently.\\n“Why they’re here, mistress?” Avin was so astonished he forgot to duck his head. “Of course,\\nthey said why—Oh, I forgot. You been downcountry. Likely you ain’t heard nothing but sheep\\nbleating. They say they’re here because of what’s going on down in Ghealdan. The Dragon, you know\\n—well, him as calls himself Dragon. They say the fellow’s stirring up evil—which I expect he is—\\nand they’re here to stamp it out, only he’s down there in Ghealdan, not here. Just an excuse to meddle\\nin other people’s business, is what I figure. There’s already been the Dragon’s Fang on some\\npeople’s doors.” This time he did spit.\\n“Have they caused much trouble, then?” Lan said, and Avin shook his head vigorously.\\n“Not that they don’t want to, I expect, only the Governor don’t trust them no more than I do. He\\nwon’t let but maybe ten or so inside the walls at one time, and ain’t they mad about that. The rest have\\na camp a little ways north, I hear.

He seemed to be polishing a coin with an edge of his cloak and chuckling.\\nThe way led through dirt streets barely the width of two wagons, empty of people, all lined with\\nwarehouses and occasional high, wooden fences. Rand walked a time beside the gleeman. “Thom,\\nwhat was all that about Tear, and the People of the Dragon? Tear is a city all the way down on the\\nSea of Storms, isn’t it?”\\n“The Karaethon Cycle,”\\n Thom said curtly.\\nRand blinked. \\nThe Prophecies of the Dragon.\\n “Nobody tells the . . . those stories in the Two\\nRivers. Not in Emond’s Field, anyway. The Wisdom would skin them alive, if they did.”\\n“I suppose she would, at that,” Thom said dryly. He glanced at Moiraine up ahead with Lan, saw\\nshe could not overhear, and went on. “Tear is the greatest port on the Sea of Storms, and the Stone of\\nTear is the fortress that guards it. The Stone is said to be the first fortress built after the Breaking of\\nthe World, and in all this time it has never fallen, though more than one army has tried. One of the\\nProphecies says that the Stone of Tear will never fall until the People of the Dragon come to the\\nStone. Another says the Stone will never fall till the Sword That Cannot Be Touched is wielded by\\nthe Dragon’s hand.” Thom grimaced. “The fall of the Stone will be one of the major proofs that the\\nDragon has been reborn. May the Stone stand till I am dust.”\\n“The sword that cannot be touched?”\\n“That’s what it says. I don’t know whether it is a sword. Whatever it is, it lies in the Heart of the\\nStone, the central citadel of the fortress. None but the High Lords of Tear can enter there, and they\\nnever speak of what lies inside. Certainly not to gleemen, anyway.”\\nRand frowned. “The Stone cannot fall until the Dragon wields the sword, but how can he, unless\\nthe Stone has already fallen? Is the Dragon supposed to be a High Lord of Tear?”\\n“Not much chance of that,” the gleeman said dryly. “Tear hates anything to do with the Power\\neven more than Amador, and Amador is the stronghold of the Children of the Light.”\\n“Then how can the Prophecy be fulfilled?” Rand asked. “I’d like it well enough if the Dragon'),\n",

He was working the blade of his dagger between two of the boards. Abruptly he\\ngave a grunt of satisfaction, pulled, and a length of the fence swung out like a gate.

Well over half the windows\\nwere aglow in the deepening twilight.

The bearers murmured quick apologies when they got in anyone’s way, but they never slowed\\nby a step. One of the men took hurried orders from Master Fitch and disappeared at a run.\\n“The inn is near full, I’m afraid,” the innkeeper told Moiraine. “Almost to the rafters. Every inn\\nin the town is the same. With the winter we just had . . . well, as soon as it cleared enough for them to\\nget down out of the mountains we were inundated—yes, that’s the word—inundated by men from the\\nmines and smelters, all telling the most horrible tales. Wolves, and worse. The kind of tales men tell\\nwhen they’ve been cooped up all winter. I can’t think there’s anyone left up there at all, we have that\\nmany here. But never fear. Things may be a little crowded, but I’ll do my best by you and Master\\nAndra. And your friends, too, of course.” He glanced curiously once or twice at Rand and the others;\\nexcept for Thom their clothes named them country folk, and Thom’s gleeman’s cloak made him a\\nstrange traveling companion as well for “Mistress Alys” and “Master Andra.” “I will do my best, you\\nmay rest assured.”\\nRand stared at the bustle around them and tried to avoid being stepped on, though none of the\\nhelp really seemed to be in any danger of that. He kept thinking of how Master al’Vere and his wife\\ntended the Winespring Inn with sometimes a little assistance from their daughters.\\nMat and Perrin craned their necks in interest toward the common room, from which rolled a\\nwave of laughter and singing and jovial shouting whenever the wide door at the end of the hall swung\\nopen. Muttering about finding out the news, the Warder grimly disappeared through that swinging\\ndoor, swallowed by a wave of merriment.\\nRand wanted to follow him, but he wanted a bath even more. He could have done with people\\nand laughing right then, but the common room would appreciate his presence more when he was\\nclean. Mat and Perrin apparently felt the same; Mat was scratching surreptitiously.\\n“Master Fitch,” Moiraine said, “I understand there are Children of the Light in Baerlon. Is there\\nlikely to be trouble?”\\n“Oh, never you worry about them, Mistress Alys. They’re up to their usual tricks. Claim there’s\\nan Aes Sedai in the town.” Moiraine lifted an eyebrow, and the innkeeper spread his plump hands.\\n“Don’t you worry. They’ve tried it before. There’s no Aes Sedai in Baerlon, and the Governor knows\\nit. The Whitecloaks think if they show an Aes Sedai, some woman they claim is an Aes Sedai, people\\nwill let all of them inside the walls. Well, I suppose some would. Some would. But most people'),\n",

No one wants to see some\\nharmless old woman hurt just so the Children can have an excuse for whipping up a frenzy.”\\n“I am glad to hear it,” Moiraine said dryly. She put a hand on the innkeeper’s arm. “Is Min still\\nhere? I wish to talk with her, if she is.”\\nMaster Fitch’s answer was lost to Rand in the arrival of attendants to lead them to the baths.\\nMoiraine and Egwene vanished behind a plump woman with a ready smile and an armload of towels.\\nThe gleeman and Rand and his friends found themselves following a slight, dark-haired fellow, Ara\\nby name.\\nRand tried asking Ara about Baerlon, but the man barely said two words together except to say\\nRand had a funny accent, and then the first sight of the bath chamber drove all thoughts of talk right out\\nof Rand’s head. A dozen tall, copper bathtubs sat in a circle on the tiled floor, which sloped down\\nslightly to a drain in the center of the big stone-walled room. A thick towel, neatly folded, and a large\\ncake of yellow soap sat on a stool behind each tub, and big black iron cauldrons of water stood\\nheating over fires along one wall. On the opposite wall logs blazing in a deep fireplace added to the\\ngeneral warmth.\\n“Almost as good as the Winespring Inn back home,” Perrin said loyally, if not exactly with a\\ngreat attention to truth.\\nThom barked a laugh, and Mat sniggered, “Sounds like we brought a Coplin with us and didn’t\\nknow it.”\\nRand shrugged out of his cloak and stripped off his clothes while Ara filled four of the copper\\ntubs. None of the others was far behind Rand in choosing a bathtub. Once their clothes were all in\\npiles on the stools, Ara brought them each a large bucket of hot water and a dipper. That done, he sat\\non a stool by the door, leaning back against the wall with his arms crossed, apparently lost in his own\\nthoughts.\\nThere was little in the way of conversation while they lathered and sluiced away a week of\\ngrime with dippers of steaming water. Then it was into the tubs for a long soak; Ara had made the\\nwater hot enough that settling in was a slow process of luxuriant sighs. The air in the room went from\\nwarm to misty and hot. For a long time there was no sound except the occasional long, relaxing\\nexhalation as tight muscles loosened and a chill that they had come to think permanent was drawn out\\nof their bones.\\n“Need anything else?” Ara asked suddenly. He did not have much room to talk about people’s\\naccents; he and Master Fitch both sounded as if they had a mouth full of mush. “More towels? More\\nhot water?”\\n“Nothing,” Thom said in his reverberant voice. Eyes closed, he gave an indolent wave of his\\nhand. “Go and enjoy the evening. At a later time I will see that you receive more than adequate\\nrecompense for your services.” He settled lower in the tub, until the water covered everything but his\\neyes and nose.\\nAra’s eyes went to the stools behind the tubs, where their clothes and belongings were stacked.\\nHe glanced at the bow, but lingered longest over Rand’s sword and Perrin’s axe. “Is there trouble\\ndowncountry, too?” he said abruptly. “In the Rivers, or whatever you call it?”\\n“The Two Rivers,” Mat said, pronouncing each separate word distinctly. “It’s the Two Rivers.\\nAs for trouble, why—”\\n“What do you mean, too?” Rand asked. “Is there some kind of trouble here?”\\nPerrin, enjoying his soak, murmured, “Good! Good!” Thom raised himself back up a little, and\\nopened his eyes.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '../example_data/wot-1.pdf', 'page': 134, 'page_label': '135'}, page_content='“Here?” Ara snorted. “Trouble? Miners having fistfights in the streets in the dark of the morning\\naren’t trouble. Or. . . .” He stopped and eyed them a moment. “I meant the Ghealdan kind of trouble,”\\nhe said finally. “No, I suppose not. Nothing but sheep downcountry, is there? No offense. I just meant\\nit’s quiet down there. Still, it’s been a strange winter. Strange things in the mountains. I heard the\\nother day there were Trollocs up in Saldaea. But that’s the Borderlands then, isn’t it?” He finished\\nwith his mouth still open, then snapped it shut, appearing surprised that he had said so much.\\nRand had tensed at the word \\nTrollocs,\\n and tried to hide it by wringing his washcloth out over his\\nhead. As the fellow went on he relaxed, but not everyone kept his mouth shut.\\n“Trollocs?” Mat chortled. Rand splashed water at him, but Mat just wiped it off of his face with\\na grin. “You just let me tell you about Trollocs.”\\nFor the first time since climbing into his tub, Thom spoke. “Why don’t you not? I am a little tired\\nof hearing my own stories back from you.”\\n“He’s a gleeman,” Perrin said, and Ara gave him a scornful look.\\n“I saw the cloak. You going to perform?”\\n“Just a minute,” Mat protested. “What’s this about me telling Thom’s stories? Are you all—?”\\n“You just don’t tell them as well as Thom,” Rand cut him off hastily, and Perrin hopped in. “You\\nkeep adding in things, trying to make it better, and they never do.”\\n“And you get it all mixed up, too,” Rand added. “Best leave it to Thom.”\\nThey were all talking so fast that Ara stared at them with his mouth hanging open. Mat stared,\\ntoo, as if everyone else had suddenly gone crazy. Rand wondered how to shut him up short of jumping\\non him.\\nThe door banged open to admit Lan, brown cloak slung over one shoulder, along with a gust of\\ncooler air that momentarily thinned the mist.\\n“Well,” the Warder said, rubbing his hands, “this is what I have been waiting for.” Ara picked\\nup a bucket, but Lan waved it away. “No, I will see to myself.” Dropping his cloak on one of the\\nstools, he bundled the bath attendant out of the room, despite the fellow’s protests, and shut the door\\nfirmly after him. He waited there a moment, his head cocked to listen, and when he turned back to the\\nrest of them his voice was stony and his eyes stabbed at Mat. “It’s a good thing I got back when I did,\\nfarmboy. Don’t you listen to what you are told?”\\n“I didn’t do anything,” Mat protested. “I was just going to tell him about the Trollocs, not\\nabout. . . .” He stopped, and leaned back from the Warder’s eyes, flat against the back of the tub.\\n“Don’t talk about Trollocs,” Lan said grimly. “Don’t even think about Trollocs.” With an angry\\nsnort he began filling himself a bathtub. “Blood and ashes, you had better remember, the Dark One\\nhas eyes and ears where you least expect. And if the Children of the Light heard Trollocs were after\\nyou, they’d be burning to get their hands on you. To them, it would be as much as naming you\\nDarkfriend. It may not be what you are used to, but until we get where we are going, keep your trust\\nsmall unless Mistress Alys or I tell you differently.” At his emphasis on the name Moiraine was\\nusing, Mat flinched.\\n“There was something that fellow wouldn’t tell us,” Rand said. “Something he thought was\\ntrouble, but he wouldn’t say what it was.”\\n“Probably the Children,” Lan said, pouring more hot water into his tub. “Most people consider\\nthem trouble. Some don’t, though, and he did not know you well enough to risk it. You might have\\ngone running to the Whitecloaks, for all he knew.”\\nRand shook his head; this place already sounded worse than Taren Ferry could possibly be.\\n“He said there were Trollocs in . . . in Saldaea, wasn’t it?” Perrin said.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '../example_data/wot-1.pdf', 'page': 135, 'page_label': '136'}, page_content='Lan hurled his empty bucket to the floor with a crash. “You will talk about it, won’t you? There\\nare always Trollocs in the Borderlands, blacksmith. Just you put it in the front of your mind that we\\nwant no more attention than mice in a field. Concentrate on that. Moiraine wants to get you all to Tar\\nValon alive, and I will do it if it can be done, but if you bring any harm to her. . . .”\\nThe rest of their bathing was done in silence, and dressing afterwards, too.\\nWhen they left the bath chamber, Moiraine was standing at the end of the hall with a slender girl\\nnot much taller than herself. At least, Rand thought it was a girl, though her dark hair was cut short\\nand she wore a man’s shirt and trousers. Moiraine said something, and the girl looked at the men\\nsharply, then nodded to Moiraine and hurried away.\\n“Well, now,” Moiraine said as they drew closer, “I am sure a bath has given you all an appetite.\\nMaster Fitch has given us a private dining room.” She talked on inconsequentially as she turned to\\nlead the way, about their rooms and the crowding in the town, and how the innkeeper hoped Thom\\nwould favor the common room with some music and a story or two. She never mentioned the girl, if\\ngirl it had been.\\nThe private dining room had a polished oak table with a dozen chairs around it, and a thick rug\\non the floor. As they entered, Egwene, freshly gleaming hair combed out around her shoulders, turned\\nfrom warming her hands at the fire crackling on the hearth. Rand had had plenty of time for thought\\nduring the long silence in the bath chamber. Lan’s constant admonitions not to trust anyone, and\\nespecially Ara being afraid to trust them, had made him think of just how alone they really were. It\\nseemed they could not trust anyone but themselves, and he was still not too sure how far they could\\ntrust Moiraine, or Lan. Just themselves. And Egwene was still Egwene. Moiraine said it would have\\nhappened to her anyway, this touching the True Source. She had no control over it, and that meant it\\nwas not her fault. And she was still Egwene.\\nHe opened his mouth to apologize, but Egwene stiffened and turned her back before he could get\\na word out. Staring sullenly at her back, he swallowed what he had been going to say. \\nAll right, then.\\nIf she wants to be like that, there’s nothing I can do.\\nMaster Fitch bustled in then, followed by four women in white aprons as long as his, with a\\nplatter holding three roast chickens and others bearing silver, and pottery dishes, and covered bowls.\\nThe women began setting the table immediately, while the innkeeper bowed to Moiraine.\\n“My apologies, Mistress Alys, for making you wait like this, but with so many people in the inn,\\nit’s a wonder anybody gets served at all. I am afraid the food isn’t what it should be, either. Just the\\nchickens, and some turnips and henpeas, with a little cheese for after. No, it just isn’t what it should\\nbe. I truly do apologize.”\\n“A feast.” Moiraine smiled. “For these troubled times, a feast indeed, Master Fitch.”\\nThe innkeeper bowed again. His wispy hair, sticking out in all directions as if he constantly ran\\nhis hands through it, made the bow comical, but his grin was so pleasant that anyone who laughed\\nwould be laughing with him, not at him. “My thanks, Mistress Alys. My thanks.” As he straightened he\\nfrowned and wiped an imagined bit of dust from the table with a corner of his apron. “It isn’t what I\\nwould have laid before you a year ago, of course. Not nearly. The winter. Yes. The winter. My\\ncellars are emptying out, and the market is all but bare. And who can blame the farm folk? Who?\\nThere’s certainly no telling when they’ll harvest another crop. No telling at all. It’s the wolves get the\\nmutton and beef that should go on people’s tables, and. . . .”\\nAbruptly he seemed to realize that this was hardly the conversation to settle his guests to a\\ncomfortable meal. “How I do run on. Full of old wind, that’s me. Old wind. Mari, Cinda, let these\\ngood people eat in peace.” He made shooing gestures at the women and, as they scurried from the'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '../example_data/wot-1.pdf', 'page': 136, 'page_label': '137'}, page_content='room, swung back to bow to Moiraine yet again. “I hope you enjoy your meal, Mistress Alys. If\\nthere’s anything else you need, just speak it, and I will fetch it. Just you speak it. It is a pleasure\\nserving you and Master Andra. A pleasure.” He gave one more deep bow and was gone, closing the\\ndoor softly behind him.\\nLan had slouched against the wall through all of this as if half asleep. Now he leaped up and was\\nat the door in two long strides. Pressing an ear to a door panel, he listened intently for a slow count of\\nthirty, then snatched open the door and stuck his head into the hall. “They’re gone,” he said at last,\\nclosing the door. “We can talk safely.”\\n“I know you say not to trust anyone,” Egwene said, “but if you suspect the innkeeper, why stay\\nhere?”\\n“I suspect him no more than anyone else,” Lan replied. “But then, until we reach Tar Valon, I\\nsuspect everyone. There, I’ll suspect only half.”\\nRand started to smile, thinking the Warder was making a joke. Then he realized there was not a\\ntrace of humor on Lan’s face. He really would suspect people in Tar Valon. Was anywhere safe?\\n“He exaggerates,” Moiraine told them soothingly. “Master Fitch is a good man, honest and\\ntrustworthy. But he does like to talk, and with the best will in the world he might let something slip to\\nthe wrong ear. And I have never yet stopped at an inn where half the maids did not listen at doors and\\nspend more time gossiping than making beds. Come, let us be seated before our meal gets cold.”\\nThey took places around the table, with Moiraine at the head and Lan at the foot, and for a while\\neveryone was too busy filling their plates for talk. It might not have been a feast, but after close to a\\nweek of flatbread and dried meat, it tasted like one.\\nAfter a time, Moiraine asked, “What did you learn in the common room?” Knives and forks\\nstilled, suspended in midair, and all eyes turned to the Warder.\\n“Little that’s good,” Lan replied. “Avin was right, at least as far as talk has it. There was a battle\\nin Ghealdan, and Logain was the victor. A dozen different stories are floating about, but they all agree\\non that.”\\nLogain? That must be the false Dragon. It was the first time Rand had heard a name put to the\\nman. Lan sounded almost as if he knew him.\\n“The Aes Sedai?” Moiraine asked quietly, and Lan shook his head.\\n“I don’t know. Some say they were all killed, some say none.” He snorted. “Some even say they\\nwent over to Logain. There’s nothing reliable, and I did not care to show too much interest.”\\n“Yes,” Moiraine said. “Little that is good.” With a deep breath she brought her attention back to\\nthe table. “And what of our own circumstances?”\\n“There, the news is better. No odd happenings, no strangers around who might be Myrddraal,\\ncertainly no Trollocs. And the Whitecloaks are busy trying to make trouble for Governor Adan\\nbecause he won’t cooperate with them. They will not even notice us unless we advertise ourselves.”\\n“Good,” Moiraine said. “That agrees with what the bath maid said. Gossip does have its points.\\nNow,” she addressed the entire company, “we have a long journey still ahead of us, but the last week\\nhas not been easy, either, so I propose to remain here tonight and tomorrow night, and leave early the\\nfollowing morning.” All the younger folk grinned; a city for the first time. Moiraine smiled, but she\\nstill said, “What does Master Andra say to that?”\\nLan eyed the grinning faces flatly. “Well enough, if they remember what I’ve told them for a\\nchange.”\\nThom snorted through his mustaches. “These country folk loose in a . . . a city.” He snorted again\\nand shook his head.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '../example_data/wot-1.pdf', 'page': 137, 'page_label': '138'}, page_content='With the crowding at the inn there were only three rooms to be had, one for Moiraine and\\nEgwene, and two to take the men. Rand found himself sharing with Lan and Thom, on the fourth floor\\nat the back, close up under the overhanging eaves, with a single small window that overlooked the\\nstableyard. Full night had fallen, and light from the inn made a pool outside. It was a small room to\\nbegin, and an extra bed set up for Thom made it smaller, though all three were narrow. And hard,\\nRand found when he threw himself down on his. Definitely not the best room.\\nThom stayed only long enough to uncase his flute and harp, then left already practicing grand\\nposes. Lan went with him.\\nIt was strange, Rand thought as he shifted uncomfortably on the bed. A week ago he would have\\nbeen downstairs like a falling rock for just the chance he might see a gleeman perform, for just the\\nrumor of it. But he had heard Thom tell his stories every night for a week, and Thom would be there\\ntomorrow night, and the next, and the hot bath had loosened kinks in muscles that he had thought\\nwould be there forever, and his first hot meal in a week oozed lethargy into him. Sleepily he\\nwondered if Lan really did know the false Dragon, Logain. A muffled shout came from belowstairs,\\nthe common room greeting Thom’s arrival, but Rand was already asleep.\\n \\nThe stone hallway was dim and shadowy, and empty except for Rand. He could not tell where\\nthe light came from, what little there was of it; the gray walls were bare of candles or lamps, nothing\\nat all to account for the faint glow that seemed to just be there. The air was still and dank, and\\nsomewhere in the distance water dripped with a steady, hollow plonk. Wherever this was, it was not\\nthe inn. Frowning, he rubbed at his forehead. Inn? His head hurt, and thoughts were hard to hold on to.\\nThere had been something about . . . an inn? It was gone, whatever it was.\\nHe licked his lips and wished he had something to drink. He was awfully thirsty, dry-as-dust\\nthirsty. It was the dripping sound that decided him. With nothing to choose by except his thirst, he\\nstarted toward that steady \\nplonk—plonk—plonk.\\nThe hallway stretched on, without any crossing corridor and without the slightest change in\\nappearance. The only features at all were the rough doors set at regular intervals in pairs, one on\\neither side of the hall, the wood splintered and dry despite the damp in the air. The shadows receded\\nahead of him, staying the same, and the dripping never came any closer. After a long time he decided\\nto try one of those doors. It opened easily, and he stepped through into a grim, stone-walled chamber.\\nOne wall opened in a series of arches onto a gray stone balcony, and beyond that was a sky such\\nas he had never seen. Striated clouds in blacks and grays, reds and oranges, streamed by as if storm\\nwinds drove them, weaving and interweaving endlessly. \\nNo one\\n could ever have seen a sky like that;\\nit could not exist.\\nHe pulled his eyes away from the balcony, but the rest of the room was no better. Odd curves\\nand peculiar angles, as if the chamber had been melted almost haphazardly out of the stone, and\\ncolumns that seemed to grow out of the gray floor. Flames roared on the hearth like a forge-fire with\\nthe bellows pumping, but gave no heat. Strange oval stones made the fireplace; they just looked like\\nstones, wet-slick despite the fire, when he looked straight at them, but when he glimpsed them from\\nthe corner of his eye they seemed to be faces instead, the faces of men and women writhing in\\nanguish, screaming silently. The high-backed chairs and the polished table in the middle of the room\\nwere perfectly ordinary, but that in itself emphasized the rest. A single mirror hung on the wall, but\\nthat was not ordinary at all. When he looked at it he saw only a blur where his reflection should have\\nbeen. Everything else in the room was shown true, but not him.\\nA man stood in front of the fireplace. He had not noticed the man when he first came in. If he had'),\n",

Dressed in dark clothes of a fine cut, he seemed in the prime of his maturity, and Rand supposed\\nwomen would have found him good-looking.\\n“Once more we meet face-to-face,” the man said and, just for an instant, his mouth and eyes\\nbecame openings into endless caverns of flame.\\nWith a yell Rand hurled himself backwards out of the room, so hard that he stumbled across the\\nhall and banged into the door there, knocking it open. He twisted and grabbed at the doorhandle to\\nkeep from falling to the floor—and found himself staring wide-eyed into a stone room with an\\nimpossible sky through the arches leading to a balcony, and a fireplace. . . .\\n“You cannot get away from me that easily,” the man said.\\nRand twisted, scrambling back out of the room, trying to regain his feet without slowing down.\\nThis time there was no corridor. He froze half crouched not far from the polished table, and looked at\\nthe man by the fireplace. It was better than looking at the fireplace stones, or at the sky.\\n“This is a dream,” he said as he straightened. Behind him he heard the click of the door closing.\\n“It’s some kind of nightmare.” He shut his eyes, thinking about waking up. When he was a child the\\nWisdom had said if you could do that in a nightmare, it would go away. \\nThe . . . Wisdom? What?\\n If\\nonly his thoughts would stop sliding away. If only his head would stop hurting, then he could think\\nstraight.\\nHe opened his eyes again. The room was still as it had been, the balcony, the sky. The man by\\nthe fireplace.\\n“Is it a dream?” the man said. “Does it matter?” Once again, for a moment, his mouth and eyes\\nbecame peepholes into a furnace that seemed to stretch forever. His voice did not change; he did not\\nseem to notice it happening at all.\\nRand jumped a little this time, but he managed to keep from yelling. \\nThis is a dream. It has to\\nbe.\\n All the same, he stepped backwards all the way to the door, never taking his eyes off the fellow\\nby the fire, and tried the handle. It did not move; the door was locked.\\n“You seem thirsty,” the man by the fire said. “Drink.”\\nOn the table was a goblet, shining gold and ornamented with rubies and amethysts. It had not\\nbeen there before. He wished he could stop jumping. It was only a dream. His mouth felt like dust.\\n“I am, a little,” he said, picking up the goblet. The man leaned forward intently, one hand on the\\nback of a chair, watching him. The smell of spiced wine drove home to Rand just how thirsty he was,\\nas if he had had nothing to drink in days. \\nHave I?\\nWith the wine halfway to his mouth, he stopped. Whispers of smoke were rising from the\\nchairback between the man’s fingers. And those eyes watched him so sharply, flickering rapidly in\\nand out of flames.\\nRand licked his lips and put the wine back on the table, untasted. “I’m not as thirsty as I thought.”\\nThe man straightened abruptly, his face without expression. His disappointment could not have been\\nmore plain if he had cursed. Rand wondered what was in the wine. But that was a stupid question, of\\ncourse. This was all a dream. \\nThen why won’t it stop?\\n “What do you want?” he demanded. “Who are\\nyou?”\\nFlames rose in the man’s eyes and mouth; Rand thought he could hear them roar. “Some call me\\nBa’alzamon.”\\nRand found himself facing the door, jerking frantically at the handle. All thought of dreams had\\nvanished. The Dark One. The doorhandle would not budge, but he kept twisting.\\n“Are you the one?” Ba’alzamon said suddenly. “You cannot hide it from me forever. You cannot'),\n",

I know you down to\\nthe smallest hair.”\\nRand turned to face the man—to face Ba’alzamon. He swallowed hard. A nightmare. He reached\\nback to give the door-handle one last pull, then stood up straighter.\\n“Are you expecting glory?” Ba’alzamon said. “Power? Did they tell you the Eye of the World\\nwould serve you? What glory or power is there for a puppet? The strings that move you have been\\ncenturies weaving. Your father was chosen by the White Tower, like a stallion roped and led to his\\nbusiness. Your mother was no more than a brood mare to their plans. And those plans lead to your\\ndeath.”\\nRand’s hands knotted in fists. “My father is a good man, and my mother was a good woman.\\nDon’t you talk about them!”\\nThe flames laughed. “So there is some spirit in you after all. Perhaps you \\nare\\n the one. Little\\ngood it will do you. The Amyrlin Seat will use you until you are consumed, just as Davian was used,\\nand Yurian Stonebow, and Guaire Amalasan, and Raolin Darksbane. Just as Logain is being used.\\nUsed until there is nothing left of you.”\\n“I don’t know. . . .” Rand swung his head from side to side. That one moment of clear thinking,\\nborn in anger, was gone. Even as he groped for it again he could not remember how he had reached it\\nthe first time. His thoughts spun around and around. He seized one like a raft in the whirlpool. He\\nforced the words out, his voice strengthening the further he went. “You . . . are bound . . . in Shayol\\nGhul. You and all the Forsaken . . . bound by the Creator until the end of time.”\\n“The end of time?” Ba’alzamon mocked. “You live like a beetle under a rock, and you think your\\nslime is the universe. The death of time will bring me power such as you could not dream of, worm.”\\n“You are bound—”\\n“Fool, I have never been bound!” The fires of his face roared so hot that Rand stepped back,\\nsheltering behind his hands. The sweat on his palms dried from the heat. “I stood at Lews Therin\\nKinslayer’s shoulder when he did the deed that named him. It was I who told him to kill his wife, and\\nhis children, and all his blood, and every living person who loved him or whom he loved. It was I\\nwho gave him the moment of sanity to know what he had done. Have you ever heard a man scream his\\nsoul away, worm? He could have struck at me, then. He could not have won, but he could have tried.\\nInstead he called down his precious One Power upon himself, so much that the earth split open and\\nreared up Dragonmount to mark his tomb.\\n“A thousand years later I sent the Trollocs ravening south, and for three centuries they savaged\\nthe world. Those blind fools in Tar Valon said I was beaten in the end, but the Second Covenant, the\\nCovenant of the Ten Nations, was shattered beyond remaking, and who was left to oppose me then? I\\nwhispered in Artur Hawkwing’s ear, and the length and breadth of the land Aes Sedai died. I\\nwhispered again, and the High King sent his armies across the Aryth Ocean, across the World Sea,\\nand sealed two dooms. The doom of his dream of one land and one people, and a doom yet to come.\\nAt his deathbed I was there when his councilors told him only Aes Sedai could save his life. I spoke,\\nand he ordered his councilors to the stake. I spoke, and the High King’s last words were to cry that\\nTar Valon must be destroyed.\\n“When men such as these could not stand against me, what chance do you have, a toad crouching\\nbeside a forest puddle.

Where it had been, crouched a large rat, blinking at the light,\\nsniffing the air warily. Ba’alzamon crooked his finger, and with a squeak the rat arched its back,\\nforepaws lifting into the air while it balanced awkwardly on its hind feet. The finger curved more,\\nand the rat toppled over, scrabbling frantically, pawing at nothing, squealing shrilly, its back bending,\\nbending, bending. With a sharp snap like the breaking of a twig, the rat trembled violently and was\\nstill, lying bent almost double.\\nRand swallowed. “Anything can happen in a dream,” he mumbled. Without looking he swung his\\nfist back against the door again. His hand hurt, but he still did not wake up.\\n“Then go to the Aes Sedai. Go to the White Tower and tell them. Tell the Amyrlin Seat of\\nthis . . . dream.” The man laughed; Rand felt the heat of the flames on his face. “That is one way to\\nescape them. They will not use you, then. No, not when they know that I know. But will they let you\\nlive, to spread the tale of what they do? Are you a big enough fool to believe they will?

A blanket. Pale\\nmoonlight shone through the single window. The shadowed shapes of the other two beds. A snore\\nfrom one of them, like canvas ripping: Thom Merrilin. A few coals gleamed among the ashes on the\\nhearth.\\nIt had been a dream, then, like that nightmare in the Winespring Inn the day of Bel Tine,\\neverything that he had heard and done all jumbled in together with old tales and nonsense from\\nnowhere. He pulled the blanket up around his shoulders, but it was not cold that made him shake. His\\nhead hurt, too. Perhaps Moiraine could do something to stop these dreams. \\nShe said she could help\\nwith nightmares.\\nWith a snort he lay back. Were the dreams really bad enough for him to ask the help of an Aes\\nSedai? On the other hand, could anything he did now get him in any deeper? He had left the Two\\nRivers, come away with an Aes Sedai. But there had not been any choice, of course. So did he have\\nany choice but to trust her? An Aes Sedai? It was as bad as the dreams, thinking about it. He huddled\\nunder his blanket, trying to find the calmness of the void the way Tam had taught him, but sleep was a\\nlong time returning.\\n'),\n",

He\\npulled a pillow over his head, but it did not really shut out the light, and he did not really want to go\\nback to sleep. There had been more dreams after the first. He could not remember any but the first, but\\nhe knew he wanted no more.\\nWith a sigh he tossed the pillow aside and sat up, wincing as he stretched. All the aches he\\nthought had soaked out in the bath were back. And his head still hurt, too. It did not surprise him. A\\ndream like that was enough to give anybody a headache. The others had already faded, but not that\\none.\\nThe other beds were empty. Light poured in through the window at a steep angle; the sun stood\\nwell above the horizon. By this hour back on the farm he would have already fixed something to eat\\nand been well into his chores. He scrambled out of bed, muttering angrily to himself. A city to see,\\nand they did not even wake him. At least someone had seen that there was water in the pitcher, and\\nstill warm, too.\\nHe washed and dressed quickly, hesitating a moment over Tam’s sword. Lan and Thom had left\\ntheir saddlebags and blanketrolls behind in the room, of course, but the Warder’s sword was nowhere\\nto be seen. Lan had worn his sword in Emond’s Field even before there was any hint of trouble. He\\nthought he would take the older man’s lead. Telling himself it was not because he had often\\ndaydreamed about walking the streets of a real city wearing a sword, he belted it on and tossed his\\ncloak over his shoulder like a sack.\\nTaking the stairs two at a time, he hurried down to the kitchen. That was surely the quickest\\nplace to get a bite, and on his only day in Baerlon he did not want to waste any more time than he\\nalready had. \\nBlood and ashes, but they could have waked me.\\nMaster Fitch was in the kitchen, confronting a plump woman whose arms were covered in flour\\nto her elbows, obviously the cook. Rather, she was confronting him, shaking her finger under his nose.\\nServing maids and scullions, potboys and spitboys, hurried about their tasks, elaborately ignoring\\nwhat was going on in front of them.\\n“. . . my Cirri is a good cat,” the cook was saying sharply, “and I won’t hear a word otherwise,\\ndo you hear? Complaining about him doing his job too well, that’s what you’re doing, if you ask me.”\\n“I have had complaints,” Master Fitch managed to get in. “Complaints, mistress.

They danced in a circle with the cook trying\\nto take her apron off and the innkeeper trying to put it back on her. “No, Sara,” he panted. “There’s no\\nneed for this. No need, I say! What would I do without you? Cirri’s a fine cat. An excellent cat. He’s\\nthe best cat in Baerlon. If anyone else complains, I’ll tell them to be thankful the cat is doing his job.\\nYes, thankful. You mustn’t go. Sara? Sara!”\\nThe cook stopped their circling and managed to snatch her apron free of him. “All right, then. All\\nright.” Clutching the apron in both hands, she still did not retie it. “But if you expect me to have\\nanything ready for midday, you’d best get out of here and let me get to it. This may be your inn, but\\nit’s my kitchen. Unless you want to do the cooking?” She made as if to hand the apron to him.\\nMaster Fitch stepped back with his hands spread wide. He opened his mouth, then stopped,\\nlooking around for the first time. The kitchen help still studiously ignored the cook and the innkeeper,\\nand Rand began an intensive search of his coat pockets, though except for the coin Moiraine had given\\nhim there was nothing in them but a few coppers and a handful of odds and ends. His pocket knife and\\nsharpening stone. Two spare bowstrings and a piece of string he had thought might be useful.\\n“I am sure, Sara,” Master Fitch said carefully, “that everything will be up to your usual\\nexcellence.” With that he took one last suspicious look at the kitchen help, then left with as much\\ndignity as he could manage.\\nSara waited until he was gone before briskly tying her apron strings again, then fastened her eye\\non Rand. “I suppose you want something to eat, eh? Well, come on in.” She gave him a quick grin. “I\\ndon’t bite, I don’t, no matter what you may have seen as you shouldn’t. Ciel, get the lad some bread\\nand cheese and milk. That’s all there is right now. Sit yourself, lad. Your friends have all gone out,\\nexcept one lad I understand wasn’t feeling well, and I expect you’ll be wanting to do the same.”\\nOne of the serving maids brought a tray while Rand took a stool at the table. He began eating as\\nthe cook went back to kneading her bread dough, but she was not finished talking.\\n“You mustn’t take any mind of what you saw, now. Master Fitch is a good enough man, though\\nthe best of you aren’t any bargains. It’s the folk complaining as has him on edge, and what do they\\nhave to complain about? Would they rather find live rats than dead ones? Though it isn’t like Cirri to\\nleave his handiwork behind. And over a dozen? Cirri wouldn’t let so many get into the inn, he\\nwouldn’t. It’s a clean place, too, and not one to be so troubled. And all with backs broken.” She\\nshook her head at the strangeness of it all.\\nThe bread and cheese turned to ashes in Rand’s mouth. “Their backs were broken?”\\nThe cook waved a floury hand. “Think on happier things, that’s my way of looking. There’s a\\ngleeman, you know. In the common room right this minute. But then, you came with him, didn’t you?\\nYou are one of those as came with Mistress Alys last evening, aren’t you? I thought you were. I won’t\\nget much chance to see this gleeman myself, I’m thinking, not with the inn as full as it is, and most of\\nthem riffraff down from the mines.” She gave the dough an especially heavy thump. “Not the sort\\nwe’d let in most times, only the whole town is filled up with them. Better than some they could be,\\nthough, I suppose. Why, I haven’t seen a gleeman since before the winter, and. . . .”\\nRand ate mechanically, not tasting anything, not listening to what the cook said. Dead rats, with\\ntheir backs broken. He finished his breakfast hastily, stammered his thanks, and hurried out. He had to\\ntalk to someone.\\nThe common room of the Stag and Lion shared little except its purpose with the same room at the\\nWinespring Inn.

Moiraine—what \\nwould\\n she do if she knew?\\nHe became aware of people staring at him as they passed, and realized he was muttering under\\nhis breath. Smoothing his coat, he straightened. He had to talk to somebody. The cook had said one of\\nthe others had not gone out. It was an effort not to run.\\nWhen he rapped on the door of the room where the other boys had slept and poked his head in,\\nonly Perrin was there, lying on his bed and still not dressed. He twisted his head on the pillow to\\nlook at Rand, then closed his eyes again. Mat’s bow and quiver were propped in the corner.\\n“I heard you weren’t feeling well,” Rand said. He came in and sat on the next bed. “I just wanted\\nto talk. I. . . .” He did not know how to bring it up, he realized. “If you’re sick,” he said, half standing,\\n“maybe you ought to sleep. I can go.”\\n“I don’t know if I’ll ever sleep again.” Perrin sighed. “I had a bad dream, if you must know, and\\ncouldn’t get back to sleep. Mat will be quick enough to tell you. He laughed this morning, when I told\\nthem why I was too tired to go out with him, but he dreamed, too. I listened to him for most of the\\nnight, tossing and muttering, and you can’t tell me he got a good night’s sleep.” He threw a thick arm\\nacross his eyes. “Light, but I’m tired. Maybe if I just stay here for an hour or two, I’ll feel like getting\\nup. Mat will never let me hear the end of it if I miss seeing Baerlon because of a dream.”\\nRand slowly lowered himself to the bed again.

He could not work up much enthusiasm for Baerlon, either, not now. He could not summon\\nenthusiasm about anything.\\nA chambermaid came by, her arms full of sheets, and gave him a concerned look. Before she\\ncould speak he moved off down the hall, shrugging into his cloak. Thom would not be finished in the\\ncommon room for hours yet. He might as well see what he could. Perhaps he could find Mat, and see\\nif Ba’alzamon had been in his dreams, too. He went downstairs more slowly this time, rubbing his\\ntemple.\\nThe stairs ended near the kitchen, so he took that way out, nodding to Sara but hurrying on when\\nshe seemed about to take up where she had left off. The stableyard was empty except for Mutch,\\nstanding in the stable door, and one of the other ostlers carrying a sack on his shoulder into the stable.\\nRand nodded to Mutch, too, but the stableman gave him a truculent look and went inside. He hoped\\nthe rest of the city was more like Sara and less like Mutch. Ready to see what a city was like, he\\npicked up his step.\\nAt the open stableyard gates, he stopped and stared. People packed the street like sheep in a pen,\\npeople swathed to the eyes in cloaks and coats, hats pulled down against the cold, weaving in and out\\nat a quick step as though the wind whistling over the rooftops blew them along, elbowing past one\\nanother with barely a word or a glance. \\nAll strangers,\\n he thought. \\nNone of them know each other.\\nThe smells were strange, too, sharp and sour and sweet all mixed in a hodgepodge that had him\\nrubbing his nose. Even at the height of Festival he had never seen so many people so jammed\\ntogether. Not even half so many. And this was only one street. Master Fitch and the cook said the\\nwhole city was full. The whole city . . . like this?\\nHe backed slowly away from the gate, away from the street full of people. It really was not right\\nto go off and leave Perrin sick in bed. And what if Thom finished his storytelling while Rand was off\\nin the city? The gleeman might go out himself, and Rand needed to talk to someone. Much better to\\nwait a bit. He breathed a sigh of relief as he turned his back on the swarming street.\\nGoing back inside the inn did not appeal to him, though, not with his headache. He sat on an\\nupended barrel against the back of the inn and hoped the cold air might help his head.\\nMutch came to the stable door from time to time to stare at him, and even across the stableyard\\nhe could make out the fellow’s disapproving scowl.

There was not much left\\nthat was funny at all.\\n“A shepherd with a heron-mark sword,” said a low, woman’s voice. “That’s almost enough to\\nmake me believe anything. What trouble are you in, downcountry boy?”\\nStartled, Rand jumped to his feet. It was the crop-haired young woman who had been with\\nMoiraine when he came out of the bath chamber, still dressed in a boy’s coat and breeches. She was a\\nlittle older than he was, he thought, with dark eyes even bigger than Egwene’s, and oddly intent.\\n“You are Rand, aren’t you?” she went on. “My name is Min.”\\n“I’m not in trouble,” he said. He did not know what Moiraine had told her, but he remembered\\nLan’s admonition not to attract any notice. “What makes you think I’m in trouble? The Two Rivers is\\na quiet place, and we’re all quiet people. No place for trouble, unless it has to do with crops, or\\nsheep.”\\n“Quiet?” Min said with a faint smile. “I’ve heard men talk about you Two Rivers folk. I’ve\\nheard the jokes about wooden-headed sheepherders, and then there are men who have actually been\\ndowncountry.”\\n“Wooden-headed?” Rand said, frowning. “What jokes?”\\n“The ones who know,” she went on as if he had not spoken, “say you walk around all smiles and\\npoliteness, just as meek and soft as butter. On the surface, anyway. Underneath, they say, you’re all as\\ntough as old oak roots. Prod too hard, they say, and you dig up stone. But the stone isn’t buried very\\ndeep in you, or in your friends. It’s as if a storm has scoured away almost all the covering. Moiraine\\ndidn’t tell me everything, but I see what I see.”\\nOld oak roots? Stone? It hardly sounded like the sort of thing the merchants or their people\\nwould say. That last made him jump, though.\\nHe looked around quickly; the stableyard was empty, and the nearest windows were closed. “I\\ndon’t know anybody named—what was it again?”\\n“Mistress Alys, then, if you prefer,” Min said with an amused look that made his cheeks color.\\n“There’s no one close enough to hear.”\\n“What makes you think Mistress Alys has another name?”\\n“Because she told me,” Min said, so patiently that he blushed again. “Not that she had a choice, I\\nsuppose.

I’ve talked to . . . others like her before.”\\n“ ‘Saw’?” Rand said.\\n“Well, I don’t suppose you’ll go running to the Children. Not considering who your traveling\\ncompanions are. The Whitecloaks wouldn’t like what I do any more than they like what she does.”\\n“I don’t understand.”\\n“She says I see pieces of the Pattern.” Min gave a little laugh and shook her head. “Sounds too\\ngrand, to me. I just see things when I look at people, and sometimes I know what they mean. I look at\\na man and a woman who’ve never even talked to one another, and I know they’ll marry. And they do.\\nThat sort of thing. She wanted me to look at you. All of you together.”\\nRand shivered. “And what did you see?”\\n“When you’re all in a group? Sparks swirling around you, thousands of them, and a big shadow,\\ndarker than midnight. It’s so strong, I almost wonder why everybody can’t see it.

But they weren’t after—I mean—”\\nMin did not seem to notice his slip. “The girl? She’s part of it. And the gleeman. All of you.\\nYou’re in love with her.” He stared at her. “I can tell that even without seeing any images. She loves\\nyou, too, but she’s not for you, or you for her. Not the way you both want.”\\n“What’s that supposed to mean?”\\n“When I look at her, I see the same as when I look at . . . Mistress Alys. Other things, things I\\ndon’t understand, too, but I know what \\nthat\\n means. She won’t refuse it.”\\n“This is all foolishness,” Rand said uncomfortably. His headache was fading to numbness; his\\nhead felt packed with wool. He wanted to get away from this girl and the things she saw. And yet. . . .\\n“What do you see when you look at . . . the rest of us?”\\n“All sorts of things,” Min said, with a grin as if she knew what he really wanted to ask. “The\\nWar . . . ah . . . Master Andra has seven ruined towers around his head, and a babe in a cradle holding\\na sword, and. . . .” She shook her head. “Men like him—you understand?—always have so many\\nimages they crowd one another. The strongest images around the gleeman are a man—not him—\\njuggling fire, and the White Tower, and that doesn’t make any sense at all for a man. The strongest\\nthings I see about the big, curly-haired fellow are a wolf, and a broken crown, and trees flowering all\\naround him. And the other one—a red eagle, an eye on a balance scale, a dagger with a ruby, a horn,\\nand a laughing face. There are other things, but you see what I mean. This time I can’t make up or\\ndown out of any of it.” She waited then, still grinning, until he finally cleared his throat and asked.\\n“What about me?”\\nHer grin stopped just short of outright laughter. “The same kind of things as the rest. A sword\\nthat isn’t a sword, a golden crown of laurel leaves, a beggar’s staff, you pouring water on sand, a\\nbloody hand and a white-hot iron, three women standing over a funeral bier with you on it, black rock\\nwet with blood—”\\n“All right,” he broke in uneasily. “You don’t have to list it all.”\\n“Most of all, I see lightning around you, some striking at you, some coming out of you. I don’t\\nknow what any of it means, except for one thing. You and I will meet again.” She gave him a quizzical\\nlook, as if she did not understand that either.\\n“Why shouldn’t we?” he said. “I’ll be coming back this way on my way home.”\\n“I suppose you will, at that.” Suddenly her grin was back, wry and mysterious, and she patted his\\ncheek. “But if I told you everything I saw, you’d be as curly-haired as your friend with the shoulders.”\\nHe jerked back from her hand as if it were red-hot. “What do you mean? Do you see anything\\nabout rats? Or dreams?”\\n“Rats! No, no rats. As for dreams, maybe it’s your idea of a dream, but I never thought it was\\nmine.”\\nHe wondered if she was crazy, grinning like that. “I have to go,” he said, edging around her.\\n“I . . . I have to meet my friends.”\\n“Go, then. But you won’t escape.”\\nHe didn’t exactly break into a run, but every step he took was quicker than the step before.\\n“Run, if you want,” she called after him. “You can’t escape from me.” Her laughter sped him\\nacross the stableyard and out into the street, into the hubbub of people. Her last words were too close\\nto what Ba’alzamon had said. He blundered into people as he hurried through the crowd, earning hard\\nlooks and hard words, but he did not slow down until he was several streets away from the inn.\\nAfter a time he began to pay attention again to where he was.

He thought Baerlon was a grand city, if not exactly in the same way as\\ncities in Thom’s stories. He wandered up broad streets, most paved with flagstone, and down narrow,\\ntwisting lanes, wherever chance and the shifting of the crowd took him. It had rained during the night,\\nand the streets that were unpaved had already been churned to mud by the crowds, but muddy streets\\nwere nothing new to him. None of the streets in Emond’s Field was paved.\\nThere certainly were no palaces, and only a few houses were very much bigger than those back\\nhome, but every house had a roof of slate or tile as fine as the roof of the Winespring Inn. He\\nsupposed there would be a palace or two in Caemlyn. As for inns, he counted nine, not one smaller\\nthan the Winespring and most as large as the Stag and Lion, and there were plenty of streets he had not\\nseen yet.\\nShops dotted every street, with awnings out front sheltering tables covered with goods,\\neverything from cloth to books to pots to boots. It was as if a hundred peddlers’ wagons had spilled\\nout their contents. He stared so much that more than once he had to hurry on at the suspicious look of a\\nshopkeeper. He had not understood the first shopkeeper’s stare. When he did understand, he started to\\nget angry until he remembered that here he was the stranger. He could not have bought much, anyway.\\nHe gasped when he saw how many coppers were exchanged for a dozen discolored apples or a\\nhandful of shriveled turnips, the sort that would be fed to the horses in the Two Rivers, but people\\nseemed eager to pay.\\nThere were certainly more than enough people, to his estimation. For a while the sheer number\\nof them almost overwhelmed him. Some wore clothes of finer cut than anyone in the Two Rivers—\\nalmost as fine as Moiraine’s—and quite a few had long, fur-lined coats that flapped around their\\nankles. The miners everybody at the inn kept talking about, they had the hunched look of men who\\ngrubbed underground. But most of the people did not look any different from those he had grown up\\nwith, not in dress or in face. He had expected they would, somehow. Indeed, some of them had so\\nmuch the look of the Two Rivers in their faces that he could imagine they belonged to one family or\\nanother that he knew around Emond’s Field. A toothless, gray-haired fellow with ears like jug\\nhandles, sitting on a bench outside one of the inns and peering mournfully into an empty tankard, could\\neasily have been Bili Congar’s close cousin. The lantern-jawed tailor sewing in front of his shop\\nmight have been Jon Thane’s brother, even to the same bald spot on the back of his head. A near\\nmirror image of Samel Crawe pushed past Rand as he turned a corner, and. . . .\\nIn disbelief he stared at a bony little man with long arms and a big nose, shoving hurriedly\\nthrough the crowd in clothes that looked like a bundle of rags. The man’s eyes were sunken and his\\ndirty face gaunt, as if he had not eaten or slept in days, but Rand could swear. . . . The ragged man\\nsaw him then, and froze in mid-step, heedless of people who all but stumbled over him. The last\\ndoubt in Rand’s mind vanished.\\n“Master Fain!” he shouted. “We all thought you were—”\\nAs quick as a blink the peddler darted away, but Rand dodged after him, calling apologies over\\nhis shoulder to the people he bumped. Through the crowd he just caught sight of Fain dashing into an\\nalleyway, and he turned after.\\nA few steps into the alleyway the peddler had stopped in his tracks. A tall fence made it into a\\ndead end. As Rand skidded to a halt, Fain rounded on him, crouching warily and backing away. He\\nflapped grimy hands at Rand to stay back. More than one rip showed in his coat, and his cloak was\\nworn and tattered as if it had seen much harder use than it was meant for.\\n“Master Fain?” Rand said hesitantly. “What is the matter?

She’s . . . she’s the Aes Sedai, is she?” A guarded look came over Fain’s face.\\n“Maybe, though. . . .” He paused, licking his lips nervously. “How long will you be at this—What\\nwas it? What did you call it?—the Stag and Lion?”\\n“We leave tomorrow,” Rand said. “But what does that have to do with—?”\\n“You just don’t know,” Fain whined, “standing there with a full belly and a good night’s sleep in\\na soft bed.

I’ve no choice, have I?

She frightens me. There’s no need to be telling her, no reason for an Aes Sedai to even\\nbe knowing I’m alive. You have to promise. You have to!”\\n“I promise,” Rand said soothingly. “But there’s no reason for you to be afraid of her. Come with\\nme. The least you’ll get is a hot meal.”\\n“Maybe. Maybe.” Fain rubbed his chin pensively. “Tomorrow, you say? In that time. . . . You\\nwon’t forget your promise?

Rand was glad he had learned a little caution. “So they didn’t get him. I wonder why\\nhe left Emond’s Field, without a word like that? Probably started running then, too, and didn’t stop\\nuntil he got here. But why was he running just now?”\\nRand shook his head and wished he had not.

About a man who killed a rat?”\\nMat stared at him without blinking. “You, too?” he said finally. “And Perrin, I suppose. I almost\\nasked him this morning, but. . . . He must have. Blood and ashes! Now somebody’s making us dream\\nthings. Rand, Iwish \\nnobody\\n knew where I was.”\\n“There were dead rats all over the inn this morning.” He did not feel as afraid at saying it as he\\nwould have earlier. He did not feel much of anything. “Their backs were broken.” His voice rang in\\nhis own ears. If he was getting sick, he might have to go to Moiraine. He was surprised that even the\\nthought of the One Power being used on him did not bother him.\\nMat took a deep breath, hitching his cloak, and looked around as if searching for somewhere to\\ngo. “What’s happening to us, Rand? What?”\\n“I don’t know. I’m going to ask Thom for advice. About whether to tell . . . anyone else.”\\n“No! Not her. Maybe him, but not her.”\\nThe sharpness of it took Rand by surprise. “Then you believed him?” He did not need to say\\nwhich “him” he meant; the grimace on Mat’s face said he understood.\\n“No,” Mat said slowly. “It’s the chances, that’s all. If we tell her, and he was lying, then maybe\\nnothing happens. Maybe. But maybe just him being in our dreams is enough for. . . . I don’t know.” He\\nstopped to swallow. “If we don’t tell her, maybe we’ll have some more dreams. Rats or no rats,\\ndreams are better than. . . . Remember the ferry? I say we keep quiet.”\\n“All right.” Rand remembered the ferry—and Moiraine’s threat, too—but somehow it seemed a\\nlong time ago. “All right.”\\n“Perrin won’t say anything, will he?” Mat went on, bouncing on his toes. “We have to get back\\nto him.

His head was as tight as a drum, and almost as empty.\\n“You can get some chicken soup when we get back to the inn,” Mat said.

He rubbed his head with both hands. It was so hard to concentrate on\\nanything.\\n“I think maybe you really are sick,” Mat said, still frowning. Suddenly he pulled Rand to a stop\\nby his coat sleeve. “Look at them.”\\nThree men in breastplates and conical steel caps, burnished till they shone like silver, were\\nmaking their way down the street toward Rand and Mat. Even the mail on their arms gleamed. Their\\nlong cloaks, pristine white and embroidered on the left breast with a golden sunburst, just cleared the\\nmud and puddles of the street. Their hands rested on their sword hilts, and they looked around them as\\nif looking at things that had wriggled out from under a rotting log. Nobody looked back, though.\\nNobody even seemed to notice them. Just the same, the three did not have to push through the crowd;\\nthe bustle parted to either side of the white-cloaked men as if by happenstance, leaving them to walk\\nin a clear space that moved with them.\\n“Do you suppose they’re Children of the Light?” Mat asked in a loud voice. A passerby looked\\nhard at Mat, then quickened his pace.\\nRand nodded. Children of the Light. Whitecloaks. Men who hated Aes Sedai. Men who told\\npeople how to live, causing trouble for those who refused to obey. If burned farms and worse could\\nbe called as mild as trouble. \\nI should be afraid,\\n he thought. \\nOr curious.\\n Something, at any rate.\\nInstead he stared at them passively.\\n“They don’t look like so much to me,” Mat said. “Full of themselves, though, aren’t they?”\\n“They don’t matter,” Rand said. “The inn. We have to talk to Perrin.”\\n“Like Eward Congar. He always has his nose in the air, too.” Suddenly Mat grinned, a twinkle in\\nhis eye. “Remember when he fell off the Wagon Bridge and had to tramp home dripping wet? That\\ntook him down a peg for a month.”\\n“What does that have to do with Perrin?”\\n“See that?” Mat pointed to a cart resting on its shafts in an alleyway just ahead of the Children.\\nA single stake held a dozen stacked barrels in place on the flat bed. “Watch.” Laughing, he darted into\\na cutler’s shop to their left.\\nRand stared after him, knowing he should do something.

But oddly, he found himself looking forward to whatever Mat was going to do.\\nSomething told him that feeling was wrong, that it was dangerous, but he smiled in anticipation\\nanyway.\\nIn a minute Mat appeared above him, climbing half out of an attic window onto the tile roof of\\nthe shop. His sling was in his hands, already beginning to whirl. Rand’s eyes went back to the cart.\\nAlmost immediately there was a sharp crack, and the stake holding the barrels broke just as the\\nWhitecloaks came abreast of the alley. People jumped out of the way as the barrels rolled down the\\ncart shafts with an empty rumble and jounced into the street, splashing mud and muddy water in every\\ndirection.

Rand glanced up at the shop roof; Mat was gone. It had been\\nan easy shot for any Two Rivers lad, but the effect was certainly all that could be hoped for. He could\\nnot help laughing; the humor seemed to be wrapped in wool, but it was still funny. When he turned\\nback to the street, the three Whitecloaks were staring straight at him.\\n“You find something funny, yes?” The one who spoke stood a little in front of the others. He\\nwore an arrogant, unblinking look, with a light in his eyes as if he knew something important,\\nsomething no one else knew.\\nRand’s laughter cut off short. He and the Children were alone with the mud and the barrels. The\\ncrowd that had been all around them had found urgent business up or down the street.\\n“Does fear of the Light hold your tongue?” Anger made the Whitecloak’s narrow face seem even\\nmore pinched. He glanced dismissively at the sword hilt sticking out from Rand’s cloak. “Perhaps\\nyou are responsible for this, yes?” Unlike the others he had a golden knot beneath the sunburst on his\\ncloak.\\nRand moved to cover the sword, but instead swept his cloak back over his shoulder. In the back\\nof his head was a frantic wonder at what he was doing, but it was a distant thought. “Accidents\\nhappen,” he said. “Even to the Children of the Light.”\\nThe narrow-faced man raised an eyebrow. “You are that dangerous, youngling?” He was not\\nmuch older than Rand.\\n“Heron-mark, Lord Bornhald,” one of the others said warningly.\\nThe narrow-faced man glanced at Rand’s sword hilt again—the bronze heron was plain—and\\nhis eyes widened momentarily. Then his gaze rose to Rand’s face, and he sniffed dismissively. “He is\\ntoo young. You are not from this place, yes?” he said coldly to Rand. “You come from where?”\\n“I just arrived in Baerlon.” A tingling thrill ran along Rand’s arms and legs. He felt flushed,\\nalmost warm. “You wouldn’t know of a good inn, would you?”\\n“You avoid my questions,” Bornhald snapped. “What evil is in you that you do not answer me?”\\nHis companions moved up to either side of him, faces hard and expressionless. Despite the mudstains\\non their cloaks, there was nothing funny about them now.\\nThe tingling filled Rand; the heat had grown to a fever. He wanted to laugh, it felt so good. A\\nsmall voice in his head shouted that something was wrong, but all he could think of was how full of\\nenergy he felt, nearly bursting with it. Smiling, he rocked on his heels and waited for what was going\\nto happen. Vaguely, distantly, he wondered what it would be.\\nThe leader’s face darkened. One of the others drew his sword enough for an inch of steel to\\nshow and spoke in a voice quivering with anger. “When the Children of the Light ask questions, you\\ngray-eyed bumpkin, we expect answers, or—” He cut off as the narrow-faced man threw an arm\\nacross his chest. Bornhald jerked his head up the street.\\nThe Town Watch had arrived, a dozen men in round steel caps and studded leather jerkins,\\ncarrying quarterstaffs as if they knew how to use them. They stood watching, silently, from ten paces\\noff.\\n“This town has lost the Light,” growled the man who had half drawn his sword. He raised his\\nvoice to shout at the Watch. “Baerlon stands in the Shadow of the Dark One!” At a gesture from\\nBornhald he slammed his blade back into its scabbard.\\nBornhald turned his attention back to Rand.

When they reached the crowded part of the street, the same seemingly\\naccidental pocket as before opened around them. The Watchmen hesitated, eyeing Rand, then\\nshouldered their quarterstaffs and followed the white-cloaked three. They had to push their way into\\nthe crowd, shouting, “Make way for the Watch!” Few did make way, except grudgingly.\\nRand still rocked on his heels, waiting. The tingle was so strong that he almost quivered; he felt\\nas if he were burning up.\\nMat came out of the shop, staring at him. “You aren’t sick,” he said finally. “You are crazy!”\\nRand drew a deep breath, and abruptly it was all gone like a pricked bubble. He staggered as it\\nvanished, the realization of what he had just done flooding in on him. Licking his lips, he met Mat’s\\nstare. “I think we had better go back to the inn, now,” he said unsteadily.\\n“Yes,” Mat said. “Yes. I think we better had.”\\nThe street had begun to fill up again, and more than one passerby stared at the two boys and\\nmurmured something to a companion. Rand was sure the story would spread. A crazy man had tried to\\nstart a fight with three Children of the Light. That was something to talk about. \\nMaybe the dreams\\n are\\ndriving me crazy.\\nThe two lost their way several times in the haphazard streets, but after a while they fell in with\\nThom Merrilin, making a grand procession all by himself through the throng. The gleeman said he was\\nout to stretch his legs and for a bit of fresh air, but whenever anyone looked twice at his colorful\\ncloak he would announce in a resounding voice, “I am at the Stag and Lion, tonight only.”\\nIt was Mat who began disjointedly telling Thom about the dream and their worry over whether\\nor not to tell Moiraine, but Rand joined in, for there were differences in exactly how they\\nremembered it. \\nOr maybe each dream\\n was \\na little different,\\n he thought. The major part of the dreams\\nwas the same, though.\\nThey had not gone far in the telling before Thom started paying full attention. When Rand\\nmentioned Ba’alzamon, the gleeman grabbed them each by a shoulder with a command to hold their\\ntongues, raised on tiptoe to look over the heads of the crowd, then hustled them out of the press to a\\ndead-end alley that was empty except for a few crates and a slat-ribbed, yellow dog huddled out of\\nthe cold.\\nThom stared out at the crowd, looking for anyone stopping to listen, before turning his attention\\nto Rand and Mat. His blue eyes bored into theirs, between flickering away to watch the mouth of the\\nalley. “Don’t ever say that name where strangers can hear.” His voice was low, but urgent. “Not even\\nwhere a stranger \\nmight\\n hear. It is a very dangerous name, even where Children of the Light are not\\nwandering the streets.”\\nMat snorted. “I could tell you about Children of the Light,” he said with a wry look at Rand.\\nThom ignored him. “If only one of you had had this dream. . . .” He tugged at his mustache\\nfuriously. “Tell me everything you can remember about it. Every detail.” He kept up his wary watch\\nwhile he listened.\\n“. . . he named the men he said had been used,” Rand said finally. He thought he had told\\neverything else. “Guaire Amalasan.

And the Eye of the World. What in the Light is that supposed to be?”\\n“A legend,” the gleeman said slowly. “Maybe. As big a legend as the Horn of Valere, at least in\\nthe Borderlands.

Nynaeve’s braid\\nwas thrown over her shoulder, the end gripped in one fist; she kept giving it little tugs the way she did\\nwhen she was being even more stubborn than usual with the Village Council. \\nPerrin was right.\\nDespite the fire it seemed freezing cold, and all coming from the two women at the table.\\nLan was leaning against the mantel, staring into the flames and rubbing his hands for warmth.\\nEgwene, her back flat against the wall, had her cloak on with the hood pulled up. Thom, Mat, and\\nPerrin stopped uncertainly in front of the door.\\nShrugging uncomfortably, Rand walked to the table. \\nSometimes you have to grab the wolf by the\\nears\\n, he reminded himself. But he remembered another old saying, too. \\nWhen you have a wolf by the\\nears, it’s as hard to let go as to hold on.\\n He felt Moiraine’s eyes on him, and Nynaeve’s, and his\\nface became hot, but he sat down anyway, halfway between the two.\\nFor a minute the room was as still as a carving, then Egwene and Perrin, and finally Mat, made\\ntheir reluctant way to the table and took seats—toward the middle, with Rand. Egwene tugged her\\nhood further forward, enough to half hide her face, and they all avoided looking at anyone.\\n“Well,” Thom snorted, from his place beside the door. “At least that much is done.”\\n“Since everyone is here,” Lan said, leaving the fireplace and filling one of the silver cups with\\nwine, “perhaps you will finally take this.” He proffered the cup to Nynaeve; she looked at it\\nsuspiciously. “There is no need to be afraid,” he said patiently. “You saw the innkeeper bring the\\nwine, and neither of us has had a chance to put anything in it. It is quite safe.”\\nThe Wisdom’s mouth tightened angrily at the word \\nafraid\\n, but she took the cup with a murmured,\\n“Thank you.”\\n“I am interested,” he said, “in how you found us.”\\n“So am I.” Moiraine leaned forward intently. “Perhaps you are willing to speak now that\\nEgwene and the boys have been brought to you?”\\nNynaeve sipped the wine before answering the Aes Sedai. “There was nowhere for you to go\\nexcept Baerlon. To be safe, though, I followed your trail. You certainly cut back and forth enough. But\\nthen, I suppose you would not care to risk meeting decent people.”\\n“You . . . followed our trail?” Lan said, truly surprised for the first time that Rand could\\nremember. “I must be getting careless.”\\n“You left very little trace, but I can track as well as any man in the Two Rivers, except perhaps\\nTam al’Thor.” She hesitated, then added, “Until my father died, he took me hunting with him, and\\ntaught me what he would have taught the sons he never had.” She looked at Lan challengingly, but he\\nonly nodded with approval.'),\n",

Few can do that, even in the\\nBorderlands.”\\nAbruptly Nynaeve buried her face in her cup. Rand’s eyes widened. She was blushing. Nynaeve\\nnever showed herself even the least bit disconcerted. Angry, yes; outraged, often; but never out of\\ncountenance. But she was certainly red-cheeked now, and trying to hide in the wine.\\n“Perhaps now,” Moiraine said quietly, “you will answer a few of my questions. I have answered\\nyours freely enough.”\\n“With a great sackful of gleeman’s tales,” Nynaeve retorted. “The only \\nfacts\\n I can see are that\\nfour young people have been carried off, for the Light alone knows what reason, by an Aes Sedai.”\\n“You have been told that isn’t known here,” Lan said sharply. “You must learn to guard your\\ntongue.”\\n“Why should I?” Nynaeve demanded. “Why should I help hide you, or what you are? I’ve come\\nto take Egwene and the boys back to Emond’s Field, not help you spirit them away.”\\nThom broke in, in a scornful voice. “If you want them to see their village again—or you, either\\n—you had better be more careful. There are those in Baerlon who would kill her”—he jerked his\\nhead toward Moiraine— “for what she is. Him, too.” He indicated Lan, then abruptly moved forward\\nto put his fists on the table. He loomed over Nynaeve, and his long mustaches and thick eyebrows\\nsuddenly seemed threatening.\\nHer eyes widened, and she started to lean back, away from him; then her back stiffened\\ndefiantly. Thom did not appear to notice; he went right on in an ominously soft voice. “They’d swarm\\nover this inn like murderous ants on a rumor, a whisper. Their hate is that strong, their desire to kill\\nor take any like these two. And the girl? The boys? You? You are all associated with them, enough\\nfor the Whitecloaks, anyway. You wouldn’t like the way they ask questions, especially when the\\nWhite Tower is involved. Whitecloak Questioners assume you’re guilty before they start, and they\\nhave only one sentence for that kind of guilt. They don’t care about finding the truth; they think they\\nknow that already. All they go after with their hot irons and pincers is a confession. Best you\\nremember some secrets are too dangerous for saying aloud, even when you think you know who\\nhears.” He straightened with a muttered, “I seem to tell that to people often of late.”\\n“Well put, gleeman,” Lan said. The Warder had that weighing look in his eyes again. “I’m\\nsurprised to find you so concerned.”\\nThom shrugged. “It’s known I arrived with you, too. I don’t care for the thought of a Questioner\\nwith a hot iron telling me to repent my sins and walk in the Light.”\\n“That,” Nynaeve put in sharply, “is just one more reason for them to come home with me in the\\nmorning. Or this afternoon, for that matter. The sooner we’re away from you and on our way back to\\nEmond’s Field, the better.”\\n“We can’t,” Rand said, and was glad that his friends all spoke up at the same time. That way\\nNynaeve’s glare had to be spread around; she spared no one as it was. But he had spoken first, and\\nthey all fell silent, looking at him. Even Moiraine sat back in her chair, watching him over steepled\\nfingers. It was an effort for him to meet the Wisdom’s eyes. “If we go back to Emond’s Field, the\\nTrollocs will come back, too. They’re . . . hunting us. I don’t know why, but they are. Maybe we can\\nfind out why in Tar Valon. Maybe we can find out how to stop it. It’s the only way.”\\nNynaeve threw up her hands. “You sound just like Tam. He had himself carried to the village\\nmeeting and tried to convince everybody. He’d already tried with the Village Council. The Light\\nknows how your . . . Mistress Alys”—she invested the name with a wagonload of scorn— “managed\\nto make him believe; he has a mite of sense, usually, more than most men. In any case, the Council is a'),\n",

He seemed more\\nafraid of that than of . . . Mistress Alys, here. But then, he was never much brighter than you.”\\nMat seemed unsure how to take what she had said, or how to reply, or even whether to reply.\\n“I expect,” Perrin began hesitantly. “I mean, I suppose Master Luhhan was not too pleased about\\nmy leaving, either.”\\n“Did you expect him to be?” Nynaeve shook her head disgustedly and looked at Egwene.\\n“Maybe I should not be surprised at this harebrained idiocy from you three, but I thought others had\\nmore judgment.”\\nEgwene sat back so she was shielded by Perrin. “I left a note,” she said faintly. She tugged at the\\nhood of her cloak as if she was afraid her unbound hair showed. “I explained everything.” Nynaeve’s\\nface darkened.\\nRand sighed. The Wisdom was on the point of one of her tongue-lashings, and it looked as if it\\nmight be a first-rate one. If she took a position in the heat of anger—if she said she intended to see\\nthem back in Emond’s Field no matter what anybody said, for instance—she would be nearly\\nimpossible to budge. He opened his mouth.\\n“A note!” Nynaeve began, just as Moiraine said, “You and I must still talk, Wisdom.”\\nIf Rand could have stopped himself, he would have, but the words poured out as if it were a\\nfloodgate he had opened instead of his mouth. “All this is very well, but it doesn’t change anything.\\nWe can’t go back. We have to go on.” He spoke more slowly toward the end, and his voice sank, so\\nhe finished in a whisper, with the Wisdom and the Aes Sedai both looking at him. It was the sort of\\nlook he received if he came on women talking Women’s Circle business, the sort that said he had\\nstepped in where he did not belong. He sat back, wishing he was somewhere else.\\n“Wisdom,” Moiraine said, “you must believe that they are safer with me than they would be\\nback in the Two Rivers.”\\n“Safer!” Nynaeve tossed her head dismissively. “You are the one who brought them here, where\\nthe Whitecloaks are. The same Whitecloaks who, if the gleeman tells the truth, may harm them\\nbecause of \\nyou.\\n Tell me how they are safer, Aes Sedai.”\\n“There are many dangers from which I cannot protect them,” Moiraine agreed, “any more than\\nyou can protect them from being struck by lightning if they go home. But it is not lightning of which\\nthey must be afraid, nor even Whitecloaks. It is the Dark One, and minions of the Dark One. From\\nthose things I \\ncan\\n protect. Touching the True Source, touching \\nsaidar\\n, gives me that protection, as it\\ndoes to every Aes Sedai.” Nynaeve’s mouth tightened skeptically. Moiraine’s grew tighter, too, with\\nanger, but she went on, her voice hard on the edge of patience. “Even those poor men who find\\nthemselves wielding the Power for a short time gain that much, though sometimes touching \\nsaidin\\nprotects, and sometimes the taint makes them more vulnerable. But I, or any Aes Sedai, can extend my\\nprotection to those close by me. No Fade can harm them as long as they are as close to me as they are\\nright now. No Trolloc can come within a quarter of a mile without Lan knowing it, feeling the evil of\\nit. Can you offer them half as much if they return to Emond’s Field with you?”\\n“You stand up straw men,” Nynaeve said. “We have a saying in the Two Rivers. ‘Whether the\\nbear beats the wolf or the wolf beats the bear, the rabbit always loses.’ Take your contest somewhere\\nelse and leave Emond’s Field folk out of it.”'),\n",

Even Lan started for the door at a signal from\\nMoiraine, drawing Thom with him.\\nRand followed, and the Warder shut the door behind them, then took up guard across the\\nhallway.

A time just a week ago.”\\nHe cleared his throat and pressed on stubbornly. “It doesn’t make sense.

She was still\\ndetermined to bring them back with her.\\n“What did she say to you in there?” he asked. Moiraine would surely have covered every\\nargument, but if there was one she had missed, he would make it.\\n“More of the same,” Nynaeve replied. “And she wanted to know about you boys.

There had only been a heartbeat’s pause before she spoke, so brief he\\nwould have missed it if he had not been watching for it.\\nHe tried to think of something to say, but his tongue felt like a piece of leather. \\nShe knows.\\n She\\nwas the Wisdom, after all, and the Wisdom was supposed to know everything about everyone. \\nIf she\\nknows, it was no fever-dream.

The Wisdom watched them with an unreadable expression, then deliberately joined\\nin another dance before she left, too, with a look as if she had gained a point on the Aes Sedai.\\nSoon Thom was putting his flute into its case and arguing good-naturedly with those who wanted\\nhim to stay longer. Lan came by to gather up Rand and the others.\\n“We have to make an early start,” the Warder said, leaning close to be heard over the noise,\\n“and we will need all the rest we can get.”\\n“There’s a fellow been staring at me,” Mat said. “A man with a scar across his face. You don’t\\nthink he could be a . . . one of the \\nfriends\\n you warned us about?”\\n“Like this?” Rand said, drawing a finger across his nose to the corner of his mouth. “He stared at\\nme, too.” He looked around the room. People were drifting away, and most of those still left clustered\\naround Thom. “He’s not here, now.”\\n“I saw the man,” Lan said. “According to Master Fitch, he’s a spy for the Whitecloaks. He’s no\\nworry to us.” Maybe he was not, but Rand could see something was bothering the Warder.\\nRand glanced at Mat, who had the stiff expression on his face that always meant he was hiding\\nsomething. \\nA Whitecloak spy. Could Bornhald want to get back at us that much?\\n “We’re leaving\\nearly?” he said. “Really early?” Maybe they could be gone before anything came of it.\\n“At first light,” the Warder replied.'),\n",

Their own shoes were not very comfortable right then. “I’m going to get some milk,” he said.\\nMaybe it would help him sleep. \\nMaybe I won’t dream tonight.\\nLan looked at him sharply. “There’s something wrong tonight. Don’t wander far. And remember,\\nwe leave whether you are awake enough to sit your saddle or have to be tied on.”\\nThe Warder started up the stairs; the others followed him, their jollity subdued. Rand stood in\\nthe hall alone. After having so many people around, it was lonely indeed.\\nHe hurried to the kitchen, where a scullery maid was still on duty. She poured a mug of milk\\nfrom a big stone crock for him.\\nAs he came out of the kitchen, drinking, a shape in dull black started toward him down the length\\nof the hall, raising pale hands to toss back the dark cowl that had hidden the face beneath. The cloak\\nhung motionless as the figure moved, and the face. . . . A man’s face, but pasty white, like a slug under\\na rock, and eyeless. From oily black hair to puffy cheeks was as smooth as an eggshell. Rand choked,\\nspraying milk.\\n“You are one of them, boy,” the Fade said, a hoarse whisper like a file softly drawn across\\nbone.\\nDropping the mug, Rand backed away. He wanted to run, but it was all he could do to make his\\nfeet take one halting step at a time. He could not break free of that eyeless face; his gaze was held,\\nand his stomach curdled. He tried to shout for help, to scream; his throat was like stone. Every ragged\\nbreath hurt.\\nThe Fade glided closer, in no hurry. Its strides had a sinuous, deadly grace, like a viper, the\\nresemblance emphasized by the overlapping black plates of armor down its chest. Thin, bloodless\\nlips curved in a cruel smile, made more mocking by the smooth, pale skin where eyes should have\\nbeen. The voice made Bornhald’s seem warm and soft. “Where are the others? I know they are here.\\nSpeak, boy, and I will let you live.”\\nRand’s back struck wood, a wall or a door—he could not make himself look around to see\\nwhich. Now that his feet had stopped, he could not make them start again. He shivered, watching the\\nMyrddraal slither nearer. His shaking grew harder with every slow stride.\\n“Speak, I say, or—”\\nFrom above came a quick clatter of boots, from the stairs up the hall, and the Myrddraal cut off,\\nwhirling. The cloak hung still. For an instant the Fade’s head tilted, as if that eyeless gaze could\\npierce the wooden wall. A sword appeared in a dead-white hand, blade as black as the cloak. The\\nlight in the hall seemed to grow dimmer in the presence of that blade. The pounding of boots grew\\nlouder, and the Fade spun back to Rand, an almost boneless movement. The black blade rose; narrow\\nlips peeled back in a rictus snarl.\\nTrembling, Rand knew he was going to die. Midnight steel flashed at his head . . . and stopped.\\n“You belong to the Great Lord of the Dark.” The breathy grating of that voice sounded like\\nfingernails scratched across a slate. “You are his.”'),\n",

With the Myrddraal facing him he had never thought of it. He fumbled the heron-mark blade\\nout now, not caring if it was too late. “It ran that way!”\\nLan nodded absently; he seemed to be listening to something else. “Yes. It’s going; fading. No\\ntime to pursue it, now. We’re leaving, sheepherder.”\\nMore boots stumbled down the stairs; Mat and Perrin and Thom, hung about with blankets and\\nsaddlebags.

In the night?”\\n“You want to wait for the Halfman to come back, sheepherder?” the Warder said impatiently.\\n“For half a dozen of them?

And Nynaeve. Egwene looked\\nfrightened almost to tears, but the Wisdom’s face was a mask of cool anger.\\n“You must take this seriously,” Moiraine was telling the innkeeper. “You will certainly have\\ntrouble here by morning. Darkfriends, perhaps; perhaps worse. When it comes, quickly make it clear\\nthat we are gone. Offer no re sis tance. Just let whoever it is know that we left in the night, and they\\nshould bother you no further. It is us they are after.”\\n“Never you worry about trouble,” Master Fitch replied jovially. “Never a bit. If any come\\naround my inn trying to make trouble for my guests . . . well, they’ll get short shrift from the lads and\\nI. Short shrift.

He will not listen.”\\n“You think Trollocs might come here hunting for us?” Mat asked.\\n“Trollocs!” Moiraine snapped. “Of course not! There are other things to fear, not the least of\\nwhich is how we were found.” Ignoring Mat’s bristle, she went right on. “The Fade cannot believe\\nwe will remain here, now that we know it has found us, but Master Fitch takes Darkfriends too\\nlightly. He thinks of them as wretches hiding in the shadows, but Darkfriends can be found in the\\nshops and streets of every city, and in the highest councils, too.

But I came to see you safely back in Emond’s Field, all of you, and I will not leave till that\\nis done. I won’t leave you alone with \\nher\\n sort.” Lights moved in the stables where the ostlers were\\nsaddling the horses.\\n“Mutch!” the innkeeper shouted from the stable door where he stood with Moiraine. “Stir your\\nbones!” He turned back to her, appearing to attempt to soothe her rather than really listening when she\\nspoke, though he did it deferentially, with bows interspersed among the orders called to the\\nstablemen.\\nThe horses were led out, the stablemen grumbling softly about the hurry and the lateness. Rand\\nheld Egwene’s bundle, handing it up to her when she was on Bela’s back. She looked back at him\\nwith wide, fear-filled eyes. \\nAt least she doesn’t think it’s an adventure anymore.\\nHe was ashamed as soon as he thought it. She was in danger because of him and the others. Even\\nriding back to Emond’s Field alone would be safer than going on. “Egwene, I. . . .”\\nThe words died in his mouth. She was too stubborn to just turn back, not after saying she was\\ngoing all the way to Tar Valon. \\nWhat about what Min saw? She’s part of it. Light, part of what?\\n“Egwene,” he said, “I’m sorry. I can’t seem to think straight anymore.”\\nShe leaned down to grip his hand hard. In the light from the stable he could see her face clearly.\\nShe did not look as frightened as she had.\\nOnce they were all mounted, Master Fitch insisted on leading them to the gates, the stablemen\\nlighting the way with their lamps. The round-bellied innkeeper bowed them on their way with\\nassurances that he would keep their secrets, and invitations to come again. Mutch watched them leave\\nas sourly as he had watched them arrive.\\nThere was one, Rand thought, who would not give short shrift to anyone, or any kind of shrift.\\nMutch would tell the first person who asked him when they had gone and everything else he could\\nthink of concerning them. A little distance down the street, he looked back. One figure stood, lamp\\nraised high, peering after them. He did not need to see the face to know it was Mutch.\\nThe streets of Baerlon were abandoned at that hour of the night; only a few faint glimmers here\\nand there escaped tightly closed shutters, and the light of the moon in its last quarter waxed and\\nwaned with the wind-driven clouds. Now and again a dog barked as they passed an alleyway, but no\\nother sound disturbed the night except their horses’ hooves and the wind whistling across the\\nrooftops. The riders held an even deeper silence, huddled in their cloaks and their own thoughts.\\nThe Warder led the way, as usual, with Moiraine and Egwene close behind. Nynaeve kept near\\nthe girl, and the others brought up the rear in a tight cluster. Lan kept the horses moving at a brisk\\nwalk.\\nRand watched the streets around them warily, and he noticed his friends doing the same. Shifting\\nmoon shadows recalled the shadows at the end of the hall, the way they had seemed to reach out to the\\nFade. An occasional noise in the distance, like a barrel toppling, or another dog barking, jerked every\\nhead around. Slowly, bit by bit as they made their way through the town, they all bunched their horses\\ncloser to Lan’s black stallion and Moiraine’s white mare.\\nAt the Caemlyn Gate Lan dismounted and hammered with his fist on the door of a small square\\nstone building squatting against the wall. A weary Watchman appeared, rubbing sleepily at his face.\\nAs Lan spoke, his sleepiness vanished, and he stared past the Warder to the others.\\n“You want to leave?” he exclaimed. “Now? In the night?

No one to come in except in daylight. That’s the\\norder. Anyway, there’re wolves out there. Killed a dozen cows in the last week. Could kill a man just\\nas easy.”\\n“No one to come in, but nothing about leaving,” Moiraine said as if that settled the matter. “You\\nsee? We are not asking you to disobey the Governor.”\\nLan pressed something into the Watchman’s hand. “For your trouble,” he murmured.\\n“I suppose,” the Watchman said slowly. He glanced at his hand; gold glinted before he hastily\\nstuffed it in his pocket. “I suppose leaving wasn’t mentioned at that. Just a minute.” He stuck his head\\nback inside. “Arin! Dar! Get out here and help me open the gate. There’s people want to leave. Don’t\\nargue. Just do it.”\\nTwo more of the Watch appeared from inside, stopping to stare in sleepy surprise at the party of\\neight waiting to leave. Under the first Watchman’s urgings they shuffled over to heave at the big\\nwheel that raised the thick bar across the gates, then turned their efforts to cranking the gates open.\\nThe crank-and-ratchet made a rapid clicking sound, but the well-oiled gates swung outward silently.\\nBefore they were even a quarter open, though, a cold voice spoke out of the darkness.\\nFive white-cloaked men walked into the light from the guardhouse door. Their cowls were\\ndrawn up to hide their faces, but each man rested his hand on his sword, and the golden suns on their\\nleft breasts were a plain announcement of who they were.

Five white hoods turned to\\nregard him, and he finished in a weaker tone. “The Children hold no sway here.

Only where the Shadow of the Dark One reigns are the Children\\ndenied, yes?” He swung his hood from the Watchman to Lan, then suddenly gave the Warder a\\nsecond, more wary, look.\\nThe Warder had not moved; in fact, he seemed completely at ease. But not many people could\\nlook at the Children so uncaringly. Lan’s stony face could as well have been looking at a bootblack.\\nWhen the Whitecloak spoke again, he sounded suspicious.\\n“What kind of people want to leave town walls in the night during times like these? With wolves\\nstalking the darkness, and the Dark One’s handiwork seen flying over the town?” He eyed the braided\\nleather band that crossed Lan’s forehead and held his long hair back. “A northerner, yes?”\\nRand hunched lower in his saddle. A Draghkar. It had to be that, unless the man just named\\nanything he did not understand as the Dark One’s handiwork. With a Fade at the Stag and Lion, he\\nshould have expected a Draghkar, but at the moment he was hardly thinking about it. He thought he\\nrecognized the Whitecloak’s voice.\\n“Travelers,” Lan replied calmly. “Of no interest to you or yours.”\\n“Everyone is of interest to the Children of the Light.”'),\n",

He has\\nlimited your numbers in the town, even had you followed. What will he do when he discovers you’re\\nharassing honest citizens at his gates?” He turned to the Watchmen. “Why have you stopped?” They\\nhesitated, put their hands back on the crank, then hesitated again when the Whitecloak spoke.\\n“The Governor does not know what happens under his nose. There is evil he does not see, or\\nsmell. But the Children of the Light see.” The Watchmen looked at one another; their hands opened\\nand closed as if regretting the spears left inside the guard house. “The Children of the Light smell the\\nevil.” The Whitecloak’s eyes turned to the people on horseback. “We smell it, and root it out.\\nWherever it is found.”\\nRand tried to make himself even smaller, but the movement drew the man’s attention.\\n“What have we here? Someone who does not wish to be seen? What do you—? Ah!” The man\\nbrushed back the hood of his white cloak, and Rand was looking at the face he had known would be\\nthere. Bornhald nodded with obvious satisfaction. “Clearly, Watchman, I have saved you from a great\\ndisaster. These are Darkfriends you were about to help escape from the Light. You should be reported\\nto your Governor for discipline, or perhaps given to the Questioners to discover your true intent this\\nnight.” He paused, eyeing the Watchman’s fear; it seemed to have no effect on him. “You would not\\nwish that, no? Instead, I will take these ruffians to our camp, that they may be questioned in the Light\\n—instead of you, yes?”\\n“You will take me to your camp, Whitecloak?” Moiraine’s voice came suddenly from every\\ndirection at once. She had moved back into the night at the Children’s approach, and shadows\\nclumped around her. “You will question me?” Darkness wreathed her as she took a step forward; it\\nmade her seem taller. “You will bar my way?”\\nAnother step, and Rand gasped. She \\nwas\\n taller, her head level with his where he sat on the\\ngray’s back. Shadows clung about her face like thunderclouds.\\n“Aes Sedai!” Bornhald shouted, and five swords flashed from their sheaths. “Die!” The other\\nfour hesitated, but he slashed at her in the same motion that cleared his sword.\\nRand cried out as Moiraine’s staff rose to intercept the blade. That delicately carved wood\\ncould not possibly stop hard-swung steel. Sword met staff, and sparks sprayed in a fountain, a hissing\\nroar hurling Bornhald back into his white-cloaked companions. All five went down in a heap.\\nTendrils of smoke rose from Bornhald’s sword, on the ground beside him, blade bent at a right angle\\nwhere it had been melted almost in two.\\n“You dare attack me!” Moiraine’s voice roared like a whirlwind. Shadow spun in on her,\\ndraped her like a hooded cloak; she loomed as high as the town wall. Her eyes glared down, a giant\\nstaring at insects.\\n“Go!” Lan shouted. In one lightning move he snatched the reins of Moiraine’s mare and leaped\\ninto his own saddle. “Now!” he commanded. His shoulders brushed either gate as his stallion tore\\nthrough the narrow opening like a flung stone.\\nFor a moment Rand remained frozen, staring. Moiraine’s head and shoulders stood above the\\nwall, now. Watchmen and Children alike cowered away from her, huddling with their backs against\\nthe front of the guard house.

For two days the\\nroad ran through the hills—cut right through them, sometimes, if they were wide enough to have made\\nthe road go much out of its way and not so big as to have made digging through too difficult. As the\\nangle of the sun shifted each day it became apparent that the road, for all it appeared straight to the\\neye, curved slowly southward as it ran east. Rand had daydreamed over Master al’Vere’s old map—\\nhalf the boys in Emond’s Field had daydreamed over it—and as he remembered, the road curved\\naround something called the Hills of Absher until it reached Whitebridge.\\nFrom time to time Lan had them dismount atop one of the hills, where he could get a good view\\nof the road both ahead and behind, and the surrounding countryside as well. The Warder would study\\nthe view while the others stretched their legs or sat under the trees and ate.\\n“I used to like cheese,” Egwene said on the third day after leaving Baerlon. She sat with her\\nback to the bole of a tree, grimacing over a dinner that was once again the same as breakfast, as\\nsupper would be. “Not a chance of tea. Nice hot tea.” She pulled her cloak tighter and shifted around\\nthe tree in a vain effort to avoid the swirling wind.\\n“Flatwort tea and andilay root,” Nynaeve was saying to Moiraine, “are best for fatigue. They\\nclear the head and dim the burn in tired muscles.”\\n“I am sure they do,” the Aes Sedai murmured, giving Nynaeve a sidelong glance.\\nNynaeve’s jaw tightened, but she continued in the same tone. “Now, if you must go without\\nsleep. . . .”\\n“No tea!” Lan said sharply to Egwene. “No fire! We can’t see them yet, but they are back there,\\nsomewhere, a Fade or two and their Trollocs, and they know we are taking this road. No need to tell\\nthem exactly where we are.”\\n“I wasn’t asking,” Egwene muttered into her cloak. “Just regretting.”\\n“If they know we’re on the road,” Perrin asked, “why don’t we go straight across to\\nWhitebridge?”\\n“Even Lan cannot travel as fast cross-country as by road,” Moiraine said, interrupting Nynaeve,\\n“especially not through the Hills of Absher.” The Wisdom gave an exasperated sigh. Rand wondered\\nwhat she was up to; after ignoring the Aes Sedai completely for the first day, Nynaeve had spent the\\nlast two trying to talk to her about herbs. Moiraine moved away from the Wisdom as she went on.'),\n",

And we would have to come back to this road\\neventually. We might find them ahead of us instead of following.”\\nRand looked doubtful, and Mat muttered something about “the long way round.”\\n“Have you seen a farm this morning?” Lan asked. “Or even the smoke from a chimney? You\\nhaven’t, because it’s all wilderness from Baerlon to Whitebridge, and Whitebridge is where we must\\ncross the Arinelle. That is the only bridge spanning the Arinelle south of Maradon, in Saldaea.”\\nThom snorted and blew out his mustaches. “What is to stop them from having someone,\\nsomething, at Whitebridge already?”\\nFrom the west came the keening wail of a horn. Lan’s head whipped around to stare back down\\nthe road behind them. Rand felt a chill. A part of him remained calm enough to think, ten miles, no\\nmore.\\n“Nothing stops them, gleeman,” the Warder said. “We trust to the Light and luck. But now we\\nknow for certain there are Trollocs behind us.”\\nMoiraine dusted her hands. “It is time for us to move on.” The Aes Sedai mounted her white\\nmare.\\nThat set off a scramble for the horses, speeded by a second winding of the horn. This time others\\nanswered, the thin sounds floating out of the west like a dirge. Rand made ready to put Cloud to a\\ngallop right away, and everyone else settled their reins with the same urgency. Everyone except Lan\\nand Moiraine. The Warder and the Aes Sedai exchanged a long look.\\n“Keep them moving, Moiraine Sedai,” Lan said finally. “I will return as soon as I am able. You\\nwill know if I fail.” Putting a hand on Mandarb’s saddle, he vaulted to the back of the black stallion\\nand galloped down the hill. Heading west. The horns sounded again.\\n“The Light go with you, last Lord of the Seven Towers,” Moiraine said almost too softly for\\nRand to hear. Drawing a deep breath, she turned Aldieb to the east. “We must go on,” she said, and\\nstarted off at a slow, steady trot. The others followed her in a tight file.\\nRand twisted once in his saddle to look for Lan, but the Warder was already lost to sight among\\nthe low hills and leafless trees. Last Lord of the Seven Towers, she had called him. He wondered\\nwhat that meant. He had not thought anyone besides himself had heard, but Thom was chewing the\\nends of his mustaches, and he had a speculative frown on his face. The gleeman seemed to know a\\ngreat many things.\\nThe horns called and answered once more behind them. Rand shifted in his saddle. They were\\ncloser this time; he was sure of it. Eight miles. Maybe seven. Mat and Egwene looked over their\\nshoulders, and Perrin hunched as if he expected something to hit him in the back. Nynaeve rode up to\\nspeak to Moiraine.\\n“Can’t we go any faster?” she asked. “Those horns are getting closer.”\\nThe Aes Sedai shook her head. “And why do they let us know they are there? Perhaps so we\\nwill hurry on without thinking of what might be ahead.”\\nThey kept on at the same steady pace. At intervals the horns gave cry behind them, and each time\\nthe sound was closer. Rand tried to stop thinking of how close, but the thought came unbidden at\\nevery brazen wail. Five miles, he was thinking anxiously, when Lan suddenly burst around the hill\\nbehind them at a gallop.\\nHe came abreast of Moiraine, reining in the stallion. “At least three fists of Trollocs, each led by\\na Halfman. Maybe five.”\\n“If you were close enough to see them,” Egwene said worriedly, “they could have seen you.\\nThey could be right on your heels.”'),\n",

They will be on us in an hour or less.”\\nHalf to herself, the Aes Sedai said, “If they had that many before, why were they not used at\\nEmond’s Field? If they did not, how did they come here since?”\\n“They are spread out to drive us before them,” Lan said, “with scouts quartering ahead of the\\nmain parties.”\\n“Driving us toward what?” Moiraine mused. As if to answer her a horn sounded in the distance\\nto the west, a long moan that was answered this time by others, all ahead of them. Moiraine stopped\\nAldieb; the others followed her lead, Thom and the Emond’s Field folk looking around fearfully.\\nHorns cried out before them, and behind. Rand thought they held a note of triumph.\\n“What do we do now?” Nynaeve demanded angrily. “Where do we go?”\\n“All that is left is north or south,” Moiraine said, more thinking aloud than answering the\\nWisdom. “To the south are the Hills of Absher, barren and dead, and the Taren, with no way to cross,\\nand no traffic by boat. To the north, we can reach the Arinelle before nightfall, and there will be a\\nchance of a trader’s boat. If the ice has broken at Maradon.”\\n“There is a place the Trollocs will not go,” Lan said, but Moiraine’s head whipped around\\nsharply.\\n“No!” She motioned to the Warder, and he put his head close to hers so their talk could not be\\noverheard.\\nThe horns winded, and Rand’s horse danced nervously.\\n“They’re trying to frighten us,” Thom growled, attempting to steady his mount. He sounded half\\nangry and half as if the Trollocs were succeeding. “They’re trying to scare us until we panic and run.\\nThey’ll have us, then.”\\nEgwene’s head swung with every blast of a horn, staring first ahead of them, then behind, as if\\nlooking for the first Trollocs.

The horns were closer, too. And directly behind them. He was sure of it. Behind and\\ncoming closer.\\nThey topped another hill.\\nBelow them, just starting up the slope, marched Trollocs carrying poles tipped with great loops\\nof rope or long hooks. Many Trollocs.

Again.\\nA noose on the end of a pole swept at Rand’s head. With an awkward slash, he cut the catchpole\\nin two, then hacked the goat-faced Trolloc that held it. A hook caught his shoulder from behind and\\ntangled in his cloak, jerking him backwards. Frantically, almost losing his sword, he clutched the\\npommel of his saddle to keep his seat. Cloud twisted, shrieking. Rand hung onto saddle and reins\\ndesperately; he could feel himself slipping, inch by inch, falling to the hook. Cloud swung around; for\\nan instant Rand saw Perrin, half out of his saddle, struggling to wrest his axe away from three\\nTrollocs. They had him by one arm and both legs. Cloud plunged, and only Trollocs filled Rand’s\\neyes.\\nA Trolloc dashed in and seized Rand’s leg, forcing his foot free of the stirrup. Panting, he let go\\nof the saddle to stab it. Instantly the hook pulled him out of the saddle, to Cloud’s hindquarters; his\\ndeath-grip on the reins was all that kept him from the ground. Cloud reared and shrieked. And in that\\nsame moment the pulling vanished. The Trolloc at his leg threw up its hands and screamed. All of the\\nTrollocs screamed, a howl like all the dogs in the world gone mad.\\nAround the humans Trollocs fell writhing to the ground, tearing at their hair, clawing their own\\nfaces. All of the Trollocs. Biting at the ground, snapping at nothing, howling, howling, howling.\\nThen Rand saw the Myrddraal.

That is what I’ve heard, anyway.”\\n“Ride!” Lan shouted angrily. The Warder had already gathered Moiraine and the other two\\nwomen and had them halfway up the next hill. “This is not all of them!” Indeed, the horns dirged\\nagain, above the shrieks of the Trollocs on the ground, to east and west and south.\\nFor a wonder, Mat was the only one who had been unhorsed. Rand trotted toward him, but Mat\\ntossed a noose away from him with a shudder, gathered his bow, and scrambled into his saddle\\nunaided, though rubbing at his throat.\\nThe horns bayed like hounds with the scent of a deer.

This was Aes Sedai work like the stories told\\nabout; Rand wished he were a hundred miles away. The tremble became a shaking that set the trees\\naround them quivering. The gray stumbled and nearly fell. Even Mandarb and riderless Aldieb\\nstaggered as if drunk, and those who rode had to cling to reins and manes, to anything, to keep their\\nseats.\\nThe Aes Sedai still stood as she had begun, holding the \\nangreal\\n and her upright staff thrust into\\nthe hilltop, and neither she nor the staff moved an inch, for all that the ground shook and shivered\\naround her. Now the ground rippled, springing out from in front of her staff, lapping toward the\\nTrollocs like ripples on a pond, ripples that grew as they ran, toppling old bushes, flinging dead\\nleaves into the air, growing, becoming waves of earth, rolling toward the Trollocs. Trees in the\\nhollow lashed like switches in the hands of small boys. On the far slope Trollocs fell in heaps,\\ntumbled over and over by the raging earth.\\nYet as if the ground were not rearing all around them, the Myrddraal moved forward in a line,\\ntheir dead-black horses never missing a step, every hoof in unison.

She pointed to the hollow\\nbetween the hills, and flame gouted from the ground, a fountain twenty feet high. She flung her arms\\nwide, and the fire raced to left and right as far as the eye could see, spreading into a wall separating\\nhumans and Trollocs. The heat made Rand put his hands in front of his face, even on the hilltop. The\\nMyrddraal’s black mounts, whatever strange powers they had, screamed at the fire, reared and fought\\ntheir riders as the Myrddraal beat at them, trying to force them through the flames.\\n“Blood and ashes,” Mat said faintly. Rand nodded numbly.\\nAbruptly Moiraine wavered and would have fallen had Lan not leaped from his horse to catch\\nher. “Go on,” he told the others. The harshness of his voice was at odds with the gentle way he lifted\\nthe Aes Sedai to her saddle. “That fire won’t burn forever. Hurry! Every minute counts!”\\nThe wall of flame roared as if it would indeed burn forever, but Rand did not argue. They\\ngalloped northward as fast as they could make their horses go.

She sounded tired yet confident, and her gaze was as compelling as ever.\\n“I am not at my strongest when working with Earth and Fire. A small thing.”\\nThe two of them moved into the lead again at a fast walk. Rand did not think Moiraine could stay\\nin the saddle at any faster pace. Nynaeve rode foward beside the Aes Sedai, steadying her with a\\nhand. For a time as the party went on across the hills the two women whispered, then the Wisdom\\ndelved into her cloak and handed a small packet to Moiraine. Moiraine unfolded it and swallowed\\nthe contents. Nynaeve said something more, then fell back with the others, ignoring their questioning\\nlooks. Despite their circumstances, Rand thought she had a slight look of satisfaction.\\nHe did not really care what the Wisdom was up to. He rubbed the hilt of his sword continually,\\nand whenever he realized what he was doing, he stared down at it in wonder. \\nSo that’s what a battle\\nis like.\\n He could not remember much of it, not any particular part.

Mat was scrubbing sweat off his face with the edge of his cloak.\\nPerrin, staring at something in the distance and not liking what he was seeing, appeared unaware of\\nthe beads glistening on his forehead.\\nThe hills grew smaller, and the land began to level out, but instead of pressing on, Lan stopped.\\nNynaeve moved as if to rejoin Moiraine, but the Warder’s look kept her away. He and the Aes Sedai\\nrode ahead and put their heads together, and from Moiraine’s gestures it became apparent they were\\narguing. Nynaeve and Thom stared at them, the Wisdom frowning worriedly, the gleeman muttering\\nunder his breath and pausing to stare back the way they had come, but everyone else avoided looking\\nat them altogether. Who knew what might come out of an argument between an Aes Sedai and a\\nWarder?\\nAfter a few minutes Egwene spoke to Rand quietly, casting an uneasy eye at the still-arguing\\npair. “Those things you were shouting at the Trollocs.” She stopped as if unsure how to proceed.\\n“What about them?” Rand asked. He felt a little awkward—warcries were all right for Warders;\\nTwo Rivers folk did not do things like that, whatever Moiraine said—but if she made fun of him over\\nit. . . . “Mat must have repeated that story ten times.”\\n“And badly,” Thom put in. Mat grunted in protest.\\n“However he told it,” Rand said, “we’ve all heard it any number of times. Besides, we had to\\nshout something. I mean, that’s what you do at a time like that. You heard Lan.”\\n“And we have a right,” Perrin added thoughtfully. “Moiraine says we’re all descended from\\nthose Manetheren people. They fought the Dark One, and we’re fighting the Dark One. That gives us a\\nright.”\\nEgwene sniffed as if to show what she thought of that. “I wasn’t talking about that. What . . . what\\nwas it you were shouting, Mat?”\\nMat shrugged uncomfortably. “I don’t remember.” He stared at them defensively. “Well, I don’t.\\nIt’s all foggy. I don’t know what it was, or where it came from, or what it means.” He gave a self-\\ndeprecating laugh. “I don’t suppose it means anything.”\\n“I . . . I think it does,” Egwene said slowly. “When you shouted, I thought—just for a minute—I\\nthought I understood you. But it’s all gone, now.” She sighed and shook her head. “Perhaps you’re\\nright. Strange what you can imagine at a time like that, isn’t it?”\\n“Carai an Caldazar,”\\n Moiraine said. They all twisted to stare at her. “\\nCarai an Ellisande. Al\\nEllisande.\\n For the honor of the Red Eagle. For the honor of the Rose of the Sun. The Rose of the Sun.\\nThe ancient warcry of Manetheren, and the warcry of its last king.

The old\\nblood still sings.”\\nMat and Egwene looked at each other, while everyone else looked at them both. Egwene’s eyes\\nwere wide, and her mouth kept quirking into a smile that she bit back every time it began, as if she\\nwas not sure just how to take this talk of the old blood. Mat was sure, from the scowling frown on his\\nface.\\nRand thought he knew what Mat was thinking. The same thing he was thinking. If Mat was a\\ndescendant of the ancient kings of Manetheren, maybe the Trollocs were really after him and not all\\nthree of them. The thought made him ashamed.

Do you\\nintend to remain here for the rest of the day, Aes Sedai?”\\n“No,” Moiraine replied, gathering her reins.\\nA Trolloc horn keened from the south as if to emphasize her word. More horns answered, east\\nand west. The horses whickered and sidled about nervously.\\n“They have passed the fire,” Lan said calmly. He turned to Moiraine. “You are not strong enough\\nfor what you intend, not yet, not without rest. And neither Myrddraal nor Trolloc will enter that\\nplace.”\\nMoiraine raised a hand as if to cut him off, then sighed and let it fall instead. “Very well,” she\\nsaid irritably. “You are right, I suppose, but I would rather there was any other choice.” She pulled\\nher staff from under the girth strap of her saddle. “Gather in around me, all of you. As close as you\\ncan. Closer.”\\nRand urged Cloud nearer the Aes Sedai’s mare. At Moiraine’s insistence they kept on crowding\\ncloser in a circle around her until every horse had its head stretched over the croup or withers of\\nanother. Only then was the Aes Sedai satisfied. Then, without speaking, she stood in the stirrups and\\nswung her staff over their heads, stretching to make certain it covered everyone.\\nRand flinched each time the staff passed over him.

This is not even an \\nangreal,\\nmerely an aid to concentration.” Wearily she slid the staff back under her girth strap. “Lan?”\\n“Follow me,” the Warder said, “and keep quiet. It will ruin everything if the Trollocs hear us.”\\nHe led the way north again, not at the crashing pace they had been making, but rather in the quick\\nwalk with which they had traveled the Caemlyn Road. The land continued to flatten, though the forest\\nremained as thick.\\nTheir path was no longer straight, as it had been before, for Lan chose out a route that meandered\\nover hard ground and rocky outcrops, and he no longer let them force their way through tangles of\\nbrush, instead taking the time to make their way around.

Under almost every low\\nplace in the wall was a brush-covered hill; rubble from the collapsed wall above. No two of the\\nguard towers were the same height.\\n“I wonder what city it was,” Egwene mused. “I wonder what happened to it. I don’t remember\\nanything from papa’s map.”\\n“It was called Aridhol,” Moiraine said. “In the days of the Trolloc Wars, it was an ally of\\nManetheren.” Staring at the massive walls, she seemed almost unaware of the others, even of\\nNynaeve, who supported her in the saddle with a hand on her arm. “Later Aridhol died, and this place\\nwas called by another name.”\\n“What name?” Mat asked.\\n“Here,” Lan said. He stopped Mandarb in front of what had once been a gate wide enough for\\nfifty men to march through abreast. Only the broken, vine-encrusted watchtowers remained; of the\\ngates there was no sign. “We enter here.” Trolloc horns shrieked in the distance. Lan peered in the\\ndirection of the sound, then looked at the sun, halfway down toward the treetops in the west. “They\\nhave discovered it’s a false trail. Come, we must find shelter before dark.”\\n“What name?” Mat asked again.\\nMoiraine answered as they rode into the city. “Shadar Logoth,” she said. “It is called Shadar\\nLogoth.”\\n'),\n",

The\\nentire city was broken, what Rand could see of it, and as abandoned as Perrin had said. Not so much\\nas a pigeon moved, and weeds, mainly old and dead, sprouted from cracks in walls as well as\\npavement. More buildings had roofs fallen in than had them whole. Tumbled walls spilled fans of\\nbrick and stone into the streets. Towers stopped, abrupt and jagged, like broken sticks. Uneven rubble\\nhills with a few stunted trees growing on their slopes could have been the remains of palaces or of\\nentire blocks of the city.\\nYet what was left standing was enough to take Rand’s breath. The largest building in Baerlon\\nwould have vanished in the shadows of almost anything here. Pale marble palaces topped with huge\\ndomes met him wherever he looked. Every building appeared to have at least one dome; some had\\nfour or five, and each one shaped differently. Long walks lined by columns ran hundreds of paces to\\ntowers that seemed to reach the sky. At every intersection stood a bronze fountain, or the alabaster\\nspire of a monument, or a statue on a pedestal. If the fountains were dry, most of the spires toppled,\\nand many of the statues broken, what remained was so great that he could only marvel.\\nAnd I thought Baerlon was a city! Burn me, but Thom must have been laughing up his sleeve.\\nMoiraine and Lan, too.\\nHe was so caught up in staring that he was taken by surprise when Lan suddenly stopped in front\\nof a white stone building that had once been twice as big as the Stag and Lion in Baerlon. There was\\nnothing to say what it had been when the city lived and was great, perhaps even an inn. Only a hollow\\nshell remained of the upper floors—the afternoon sky was visible through empty window frames,\\nglass and wood alike long since gone—but the ground floor seemed sound enough.\\nMoiraine, hands still on the pommel, studied the building intently before nodding. “This will\\ndo.”\\nLan leaped from his saddle and lifted the Aes Sedai down in his arms. “Bring the horses inside,”\\nhe commanded. “Find a room in the back to use for a stable. Move, farmboys. This isn’t the village\\ngreen.” He vanished inside carrying the Aes Sedai.\\nNynaeve scrambled down and hurried after him, clutching her bag of herbs and ointments.\\nEgwene was right behind her. They left their mounts standing.\\n“ ‘Bring the horses inside,’ ” Thom muttered wryly, and puffed out his mustaches. He climbed\\ndown, stiff and slow, knuckled his back, and gave a long sigh, then took Aldieb’s reins. “Well?” he\\nsaid, lifting an eyebrow at Rand and his friends.\\nThey hurried to dismount, and gathered up the rest of the horses. The doorway, without anything\\nto say there had ever been a door in it, was more than big enough to get the animals through, even two\\nabreast.'),\n",

Nothing else. Lan\\nhad made a place in the nearest corner for Moiraine with his cloak and hers. Nynaeve, muttering\\nabout the dust, knelt beside the Aes Sedai, digging in her bag, which Egwene held open.\\n“I may not like her, it is true,” Nynaeve was saying to the Warder as Rand, leading Bela and\\nCloud, came in behind Thom, “but I help anyone who needs my help, whether I like them or not.”\\n“I made no accusation, Wisdom. I only said, have a care with your herbs.”\\nShe gave him a look from the corner of her eye. “The fact is, she needs my herbs, and so do\\nyou.” Her voice was acerbic to start, and grew more tart as she spoke. “The fact is, she can only do\\nso much, even with her One Power, and she has done about as much as she can without collapsing.\\nThe fact is, your sword cannot help her now, Lord of the Seven Towers, but my herbs can.”\\nMoiraine laid a hand on Lan’s arm. “Be at ease, Lan. She means no harm. She simply does not\\nknow.” The Warder snorted derisively.\\nNynaeve stopped digging in her bag and looked at him, frowning, but it was to Moiraine she\\nspoke. “There are many things I don’t know. What thing is this?”\\n“For one,” Moiraine replied, “all I truly need is a little rest. For another, I agree with you. Your\\nskills and knowledge will be more useful than I thought. Now, if you have something that will help me\\nsleep for an hour and not leave me groggy—?”\\n“A weak tea of foxtail, marisin, and—”\\nRand missed the last of it as he followed Thom into a room behind the first, a chamber just as\\nbig and even emptier. Here was only the dust, thick and undisturbed until they came. Not even the\\ntracks of birds or small animals marked the floor.\\nRand began to unsaddle Bela and Cloud, and Thom, Aldieb and his gelding, and Perrin, his\\nhorse and Mandarb. All but Mat. He dropped his reins in the middle of the room. There were two\\ndoorways from the room besides the one by which they had entered.\\n“Alley,” Mat announced, drawing his head back in from the first. They could all see that much\\nfrom where they were. The second doorway was only a black rectangle in the rear wall. Mat went\\nthrough slowly, and came out much faster, vigorously brushing old cobwebs out of his hair. “Nothing\\nin there,” he said, giving the alleyway another look.\\n“You going to take care of your horse?” Perrin said. He had already finished his own and was\\nlifting the saddle from Mandarb. Strangely, the fierce-eyed stallion gave him no trouble at all, though\\nhe did watch Perrin. “Nobody is going to do it for you.”\\nMat gave the alley one last look and went to his horse with a sigh.\\nAs Rand laid Bela’s saddle on the floor, he noticed that Mat had taken on a glum stare. His eyes\\nseemed a thousand miles away, and he was moving by rote.\\n“Are you all right, Mat?” Rand said. Mat lifted the saddle from his horse, and stood holding it.\\n“Mat? Mat!”\\nMat gave a start and almost dropped the saddle. “What? Oh. I . . . I was just thinking.”\\n“Thinking?” Perrin hooted from where he was replacing Mandarb’s bridle with a hackamore.\\n“You were asleep.”\\nMat scowled. “I was thinking about . . . about what happened back there. About those words\\nI. . . .” Everybody turned to look at him then, not just Rand, and he shifted uneasily. “Well, you heard\\nwhat Moiraine said. It’s as if some dead man was speaking with my mouth. I don’t like it.” His scowl\\ngrew deeper when Perrin chuckled.\\n“Aemon’s warcry, she said—right? Maybe you’re Aemon come back again. The way you go on'),\n",

The dead can be reborn, or take a living body, and it is not something to speak of\\nlightly.” He took another breath to calm himself before going on. “The old blood, she said. The blood,\\nnot a dead man. I’ve heard that it can happen, sometimes. Heard, though I never really thought. . . . It\\nwas your roots, boy. A line running from you to your father to your grandfather, right on back to\\nManetheren, and maybe beyond. Well, now you know your family is old. You ought to let it go at that\\nand be glad. Most people don’t know much more than that they had a father.”\\nSome of us can’t even be sure of that,\\n Rand thought bitterly. \\nMaybe the Wisdom was right.\\nLight, I hope she was.\\nMat nodded at what the gleeman said. “I suppose I should. Only . . . do you think it has anything\\nto do with what’s happened to us? The Trollocs and all? I mean . . . oh, I don’t know what I mean.”\\n“I think you ought to forget about it, and concentrate on getting out of here safely.” Thom\\nproduced his long-stemmed pipe from inside his cloak. “And I think I am going to have a smoke.”\\nWith a waggle of the pipe in their direction, he disappeared into the front room.\\n“We are all in this together, not just one of us,” Rand told Mat.\\nMat gave himself a shake, and laughed, a short bark. “Right. Well, speaking of being in things\\ntogether, now that we’re done with the horses, why don’t we go see a little more of this city. A real\\ncity, and no crowds to jostle your elbow and poke you in the ribs. Nobody looking down their long\\nnoses at us. There’s still an hour, maybe two, of daylight left.”\\n“Aren’t you forgetting the Trollocs?” Perrin said.\\nMat shook his head scornfully. “Lan said they wouldn’t come in here, remember? You need to\\nlisten to what people say.”\\n“I remember,” Perrin said. “And I do listen. This city—Aridhol?—was an ally of Manetheren.\\nSee? I listen.”\\n“Aridhol must have been the greatest city in the Trolloc Wars,” Rand said, “for the Trollocs to\\nstill be afraid of it. They weren’t afraid to come into the Two Rivers, and Moiraine said Manetheren\\nwas—how did she put it?—a thorn to the Dark One’s foot.”\\nPerrin raised his hands. “Don’t mention the Shepherd of the Night. Please?”\\n“What do you say?” Mat laughed. “Let’s go.”\\n“We should ask Moiraine,” Perrin said, and Mat threw up his hands.\\n“Ask Moiraine? You think she’ll let us out of her sight? And what about Nynaeve? Blood and\\nashes, Perrin, why not ask Mistress Luhhan while you’re about it?”\\nPerrin nodded reluctant agreement, and Mat turned to Rand with a grin. “What about you? A real\\ncity? With palaces!” He gave a sly laugh. “And no Whitecloaks to stare at us.”\\nRand gave him a dirty look, but he hesitated only a minute. Those palaces were like a gleeman’s\\ntale. “All right.”\\nStepping softly so as not to be heard in the front room, they left by the alley, following it away\\nfrom the front of the building to a street on the other side. They walked quickly, and when they were a\\nblock away from the white stone building Mat suddenly broke into a capering dance.\\n“Free.” He laughed. “Free!” He slowed until he was turning a circle, staring at everything and\\nstill laughing. The afternoon shadows stretched long and jagged, and the sinking sun made the ruined\\ncity golden. “Did you ever even dream of a place like this? Did you?”\\nPerrin laughed, too, but Rand shrugged uncomfortably. This was nothing like the city in his first\\ndream, but just the same. . . . “If we’re going to see anything,” he said, “we had better get on with it.'),\n",

Some they\\nunderstood, and some not. A palace was plainly a palace, but what was a huge building that was one\\nround, white dome as big as a hill outside and one monstrous room inside? And a walled place, open\\nto the sky and big enough to have held all of Emond’s Field, surrounded by row on row on row of\\nstone benches?\\nMat grew impatient when they found nothing but dust, or rubble, or colorless rags of wall\\nhangings that crumbled at a touch. Once some wooden chairs stood stacked against a wall; they all\\nfell to bits when Perrin tried to pick one up.\\nThe palaces, with their huge, empty chambers, some of which could have held the Winespring\\nInn with room to spare on every side and above as well, made Rand think too much of the people who\\nhad once filled them. He thought everybody in the Two Rivers could have stood under that round\\ndome, and as for the place with the stone benches. . . . He could almost imagine he could see the\\npeople in the shadows, staring in disapproval at the three intruders disturbing their rest.\\nFinally even Mat tired, grand as the buildings were, and remembered that he had had only an\\nhour’s sleep the night before. Everyone began to remember that. Yawning, they sat on the steps of a\\ntall building fronted by row on row of tall stone columns and argued about what to do next.\\n“Go back,” Rand said, “and get some sleep.” He put the back of his hand against his mouth.\\nWhen he could talk again, he said, “Sleep. That’s all I want.”\\n“You can sleep anytime,” Mat said determinedly. “Look at where we are. A ruined city.\\nTreasure.”\\n“Treasure?” Perrin’s jaws cracked. “There isn’t any treasure here. There isn’t anything but\\ndust.”\\nRand shaded his eyes against the sun, a red ball sitting close to the rooftops. “It’s getting late,\\nMat. It’ll be dark soon.”\\n“There could be treasure,” Mat maintained stoutly. “Anyway, I want to climb one of the towers.\\nLook at that one over there. It’s whole. I’ll bet you could see for miles from up there. What do you\\nsay?”\\n“The towers are not safe,” said a man’s voice behind them.\\nRand leaped to his feet and spun around clutching his sword hilt, and the others were just as\\nquick.\\nA man stood in the shadows among the columns at the top of the stairs. He took half a step\\nforward, raised his hand to shield his eyes, and stepped back again. “Forgive me,” he said smoothly.\\n“I have been quite a long time in the dark inside. My eyes are not yet used to the light.”\\n“Who are you?” Rand thought the man’s accent sounded odd, even after Baerlon; some words he\\npronounced strangely, so Rand could barely understand them. “What are you doing here? We thought\\nthe city was empty.”\\n“I am Mordeth.” He paused as if expecting them to recognize the name. When none of them gave\\nany sign of doing so, he muttered something under his breath and went on. “I could ask the same\\nquestions of you. There has been no one in Aridhol for a long time. A long, long time. I would not\\nhave thought to find three young men wandering its streets.”\\n“We’re on our way to Caemlyn,” Rand said. “We stopped to take shelter for the night.”\\n“Caemlyn,” Mordeth said slowly, rolling the name around his tongue, then shook his head.'),\n",

Much more. More than I can carry away. I never expected to find three strong,\\nhealthy young men. If you will help me move what I \\ncan\\n take to where my horses are, you may each\\nhave a share of the rest. As much as you can carry.

He darted up the stairs.\\n“We’ll help you carry it. Just take us to it.” He and Mordeth moved deeper into the shadows among\\nthe columns.\\nRand looked at Perrin. “We can’t leave him.” Perrin glanced at the sinking sun, and nodded.\\nThey went up the stairs warily, Perrin easing his axe in its belt loop. Rand’s hand tightened on\\nhis sword. But Mat and Mordeth were waiting among the columns, Mordeth with arms folded, Mat\\npeering impatiently into the interior.\\n“Come,” Mordeth said. “I will show you the treasure.” He slipped inside, and Mat followed.\\nThere was nothing for the others to do but go on.\\nThe hall inside was shadowy, but almost immediately Mordeth turned aside and took some\\nnarrow steps that wound around and down through deeper and deeper dark until they fumbled their\\nway in pitch-blackness. Rand felt along the wall with one hand, unsure there would be a step below\\nuntil his foot met it. Even Mat began to feel uneasy, judging by his voice when he said, “It’s awfully\\ndark down here.”\\n“Yes, yes,” Mordeth replied. The man seemed to be having no trouble at all with the dark.\\n“There are lights below. Come.”\\nIndeed the winding stairs abruptly gave way to a corridor dimly lit by scattered, smoky torches\\nset in iron sconces on the walls. The flickering flames and shadows gave Rand his first good look at\\nMordeth, who hurried on without pausing, motioning them to follow.\\nThere was something odd about him, Rand thought, but he could not pick out what it was,\\nexactly. Mordeth was a sleek, somewhat overfed man, with drooping eyelids that made him seem to\\nbe hiding behind something and staring. Short, and completely bald, he walked as if he were taller\\nthan any of them. His clothes were certainly like nothing Rand had ever seen before, either. Tight\\nblack breeches and soft red boots with the tops turned down at his ankles. A long, red vest thickly\\nembroidered in gold, and a snowy white shirt with wide sleeves, the points of his cuffs hanging\\nalmost to his knees. Certainly not the kind of clothes in which to hunt through a ruined city in search of\\ntreasure. But it was not that which made him seem strange, either.\\nThen the corridor ended in a tile-walled room, and he forgot about any oddities Mordeth might\\nhave. His gasp was an echo of his friends’. Here, too, light came from a few torches staining the\\nceiling with their smoke and giving everyone more than one shadow, but that light was reflected a\\nthousand times by the gems and gold piled on the floor, mounds of coins and jewelry, goblets and\\nplates and platters, gilded, gem-encrusted swords and daggers, all heaped together carelessly in\\nwaist-high mounds.\\nWith a cry Mat ran forward and fell to his knees in front of one of the piles. “Sacks,” he said\\nbreathlessly, pawing through the gold. “We’ll need sacks to carry all of this.”\\n“We can’t carry it all,” Rand said.

He had let them rush past him into the treasure room, but\\nnow he followed. “Who else is with you?”\\nMat, wrist deep in the riches before him, answered absently. “Moiraine and Lan. And then\\nthere’s Nynaeve, and Egwene, and Thom. He’s a gleeman. We’re going to Tar Valon.”\\nRand caught his breath. Then the silence from Mordeth made him look at the man.\\nRage twisted Mordeth’s face, and fear, too. His lips pulled back from his teeth. “Tar Valon!” He\\nshook clenched fists at them. “Tar Valon! You said you were going to this . . . this . . . Caemlyn! You\\nlied to me!”\\n“If you still want,” Perrin said to Mordeth, “we’ll come back tomorrow and help you.” Carefully\\nhe set the axe back on the heap of gem-encrusted chalices and jewelry. “If you want.”\\n“No. That is. . . .” Panting, Mordeth shook his head as if he could not decide. “Take what you\\nwant. Except. . . . Except. . . .”\\nSuddenly Rand realized what had been nagging at him about the man.

He was so shocked he said it out loud. “You don’t have a shadow.”\\nA goblet fell from Mat’s hand with a crash.\\nMordeth nodded, and for the first time his fleshy eyelids opened all the way. His sleek face\\nsuddenly appeared pinched and hungry. “So.” He stood straighter, seeming taller. “It is decided.”\\nAbruptly there was no seeming to it. Like a balloon Mordeth swelled, distorted, head pressed against\\nthe ceiling, shoulders butting the walls, filling the end of the room, cutting off escape. Hollow-\\ncheeked, teeth bared in a rictus snarl, he reached out with hands big enough to engulf a man’s head.\\nWith a yell Rand leaped back. His feet tangled in a gold chain, and he crashed to the floor, the\\nwind knocked out of him. Struggling for breath, he struggled at the same time for his sword, fighting\\nhis cloak, which had become wrapped around the hilt. The yells of his friends filled the room, and the\\nclash of gold platters and goblets clattering across the floor. Suddenly an agonized scream shivered in\\nRand’s ears.\\nAlmost sobbing, he managed to inhale at last, just as he got the sword out of its sheath.\\nCautiously, he got to his feet, wondering which of his friends had given that scream.

Gold ornaments and gems scattered unnoticed under his feet.\\n“But the treasure,” Mat protested. “We \\ncan’t\\n just leave it now.”\\n“I don’t want anything of his,” Perrin said, still turning one way after another. He raised his\\nvoice and shouted at the walls. “It’s your treasure, you hear? We are not taking any of it!”\\nRand stared angrily at Mat. “Do you want him coming after us? Or are you going to wait here\\nstuffing your pockets until he comes back with ten more like him?”\\nMat just gestured to all the gold and jewels.

They hustled him out of the room, Mat struggling and\\nshouting about the treasure.\\nBefore they had gone ten steps down the hall, the already dim light behind them began to fail.\\nThe torches in the treasure room were going out. Mat stopped shouting. They hastened their steps. The\\nfirst torch outside the room winked out, then the next. By the time they reached the winding stairs\\nthere was no need to drag Mat any longer.

The others looked around\\nwarily; he knew they could feel it, too.\\n“We stay in the middle of the street,” he said hoarsely. They met his eyes; they looked as\\nfrightened as he felt.

She bristled from head to foot; her eyes\\nglittered, and bright spots of red burned on her cheeks. “Why under the Light did you run off like that?\\nAre you all right? Have you no sense at all?

Egwene began casting\\nuneasy glances at the empty windows fronting the street. Out there the last remnants of twilight were\\nfading; the fire seemed very small and dim. Thom took his pipe from between his teeth and listened\\nwith his head cocked, frowning. Moiraine’s eyes showed concern, but not an undue amount. Until. . . .\\nSuddenly the Aes Sedai hissed, and grabbed Rand’s elbow in a tight grip. “Mordeth! Are you\\nsure of that name? Be very sure, all of you. Mordeth?”\\nThey murmured a chorused “Yes,” taken aback by the Aes Sedai’s intensity.\\n“Did he touch you?” she asked them all. “Did he give you anything, or did you do anything for\\nhim? I must know.”\\n“No,” Rand said. “None of us. None of those things.”'),\n",

A Myrddraal would not even know these wards were there, for it is a different\\nkind of evil they are meant to stop, but what resides in Shadar Logoth will not cross them, or even\\ncome too near. In the morning it will be safe for us to go; these things cannot stand the light of the sun.\\nThey will be hiding deep in the earth.”\\n“Shadar Logoth?” Egwene said uncertainly. “I thought you said this city was called Aridhol.”\\n“Once it was called Aridhol,” Moiraine replied, “and was one of the Ten Nations, the lands that\\nmade the Second Covenant, the lands that stood against the Dark One from the first days after the\\nBreaking of the World. In the days when Thorin al’Toren al Ban was King of Manetheren, the King of\\nAridhol was Balwen Mayel, Balwen Ironhand. In a twilight of despair during the Trolloc Wars, when\\nit seemed the Father of Lies must surely conquer, the man called Mordeth came to Balwen’s court.”\\n“The same man?” Rand exclaimed, and Mat said, “It couldn’t be!” A glance from Moiraine\\nsilenced them.

They named it\\nShadar Logoth, the Place Where the Shadow Waits, or more simply, Shadow’s Waiting.\\n“Mordeth alone was not consumed by Mashadar, but he was snared by it, and he, too, has waited\\nwithin these walls through the long centuries.

Besides, I would know the minute of his death and the way of it, just as he would know mine.\\nRest, Nynaeve.

Telling himself he was being foolish, he added wood to the last coals of the fire.

He had been a little boy\\nagain, carrying Tam’s sword and with a cradle strapped to his back, running through empty streets,\\npursued by Mordeth, who shouted that he only wanted his hand. And there had been an old man who\\nwatched them and cackled with mad laughter the whole time.\\nHe gathered his blankets and lay back, staring at the ceiling. He wanted very much to sleep, even\\nif he had more dreams like the last one, but he could not make his eyes close.\\nSuddenly the Warder trotted silently out of the darkness into the room.

The Halfmen are having to drive them—four just to handle\\none fist—and even the Myrddraal seem to want nothing more than to pass through the city and out as\\nquickly as possible.

What forced the\\nMyrddraal?”\\nEveryone had been listening in silence. Now Thom cursed under his breath, and Egwene\\nbreathed a question. “The Dark One?”\\n“Don’t be a fool, girl,” Nynaeve snapped. “The Dark One is bound in Shayol Ghul by the\\nCreator.”\\n“For the time being, at least,” Moiraine agreed. “No, the Father of Lies is not out there, but we\\nmust leave in any case.”\\nNynaeve eyed her narrowly. “Leave the protection of the wards, and cross Shadar Logoth in the\\nnight.”\\n“Or stay here and face the Trollocs,” Moiraine said. “To hold them off here would require the\\nOne Power. It would destroy the wards and attract the very thing the wards are meant to protect\\nagainst. Besides, as well build a signal fire atop one of those towers for every Halfman within twenty\\nmiles. To leave is not what I would choose to do, but we are the hare, and it is the hounds who dictate\\nthe chase.”\\n“What if there are more outside the walls?” Mat asked. “What are we going to do?”\\n“We will use my original plan,” Moiraine said. Lan looked at her. She held up a hand and\\nadded, “Which I was too tired to carry out before. But I am rested, now, thanks to the Wisdom. We\\nwill make for the river. There, with our backs guarded by the water, I can raise a smaller ward that\\nwill hold the Trollocs and Halfmen back until we can make rafts and cross over. Or better yet, we\\nmay even be able to hail a trader’s boat coming down from Saldaea.”\\nThe faces of the Emond’s Fielders looked blank. Lan noticed.\\n“Trollocs and Myrddraal loathe deep water. Trollocs are terrified of it. Neither can swim. A\\nHalfman will not wade anything more than waist deep, especially if it’s moving. Trollocs won’t do\\neven that if they can find any way to avoid it.”\\n“So once we get across the river we’re safe,” Rand said, and the Warder nodded.\\n“The Myrddraal will find it almost as hard to make the Trollocs build rafts as it was to drive\\nthem into Shadar Logoth, and if they try to make them cross the Arinelle that way, half will run away\\nand the rest probably drown.”\\n“Get to your horses,” Moiraine said. “We are not across the river yet.”\\n'),\n",

Shadows seemed to move. Occasionally there was a clatter—rubble\\ntoppled by the wind. \\nAt least the eyes are gone.\\n His relief was momentary. Why \\nare they gone?\\nThom and the Emond’s Fielders made a cluster with him, all keeping close enough to touch one\\nanother. Egwene’s shoulders were hunched, as if she were trying to ease Bela’s hooves to the\\npavement. Rand did not even want to breathe. Sound might attract attention.\\nAbruptly he realized that a distance had opened ahead of them, separating them from the Warder\\nand the Aes Sedai. The two were indistinct shapes a good thirty paces ahead.\\n“We’re falling behind,” he murmured, and booted Cloud to a quicker step. A thin tendril of\\nsilver-gray fog drifted low across the street ahead of him.\\n“Stop!” It was a strangled shout from Moiraine, sharp and urgent, but pitched not to carry far.\\nUncertain, he pulled up short. The splinter of fog lay completely across the street now, slowly\\nfattening as if more were oozing out of the buildings on either side of the street. It was as thick as a\\nman’s arm now. Cloud whickered and tried to back further away as Egwene and Thom and the others\\ncame up on him. Their horses, too, tossed their heads and bridled against coming too near the fog.\\nLan and Moiraine rode slowly toward the fog, grown to as big around as a leg, stopping on the\\nother side, well back. The Aes Sedai studied the branch of mist that separated them. Rand shrugged at\\na sudden itch of fear between his shoulder blades.

The horses shifted\\nuneasily, even Aldieb and Mandarb.\\n“What is it?” Nynaeve asked.\\n“The evil of Shadar Logoth,” Moiraine replied. “Mashadar.

Night and ruins\\nsurrounded them. The Fades were out there, somewhere, and the Trollocs, maybe around the next\\ncorner.

It would be easy,\\nmuch easier than struggling out of his boots, for instance. But every time he thought of it, he thought of\\ncrawling out on the far bank to find Trollocs waiting. The axe would not do him much good against\\nhalf a dozen Trollocs—or even against one, maybe—but it was better than his bare hands.\\nAfter a while he was not even certain he would be able to lift the axe if Trollocs were there. His\\narms and legs became leaden; it was an effort to move them, and his face no longer came as far out of\\nthe river with each stroke.

It was not until he\\nkicked it again that he realized what it was. The bottom. He was in the shallows. He was across the\\nriver.\\nSucking air through his mouth, he got to his feet, splashing about as his legs almost gave way. He\\nfumbled his axe out of its loop as he floundered ashore, shivering in the wind. He did not see any\\nTrollocs. He did not see Egwene, either. Just a few scattered trees along the riverbank, and a\\nmoonlight ribbon on the water.\\nWhen he had his breath again, he called their names again and again. Faint shouts from the far\\nside answered him; even at that distance he could make out the harsh voices of Trollocs. His friends\\ndid not answer, though.\\nThe wind surged, its moan drowning out the Trollocs, and he shivered. It was not cold enough to\\nfreeze the water soaking his clothes, but it felt as if it was; it sliced to the bone with an icy blade.\\nHugging himself was only a gesture that did not stop the shivering. Alone, he climbed tiredly up the\\nriverbank to find shelter against the wind.\\n \\nRand patted Cloud’s neck, soothing the gray with whispers. The horse tossed his head and\\ndanced on quick feet.

But then more Trollocs had appeared, ahead, and they went galloping off to\\nthe side with both packs howling after them. The Trollocs could keep up with a horse, but only for a\\nhundred paces or so, and finally they left the pursuit and the howls behind. But with all the twists and\\nturns, they had lost the guiding star.\\n“I still say it’s over there,” Mat said, gesturing off to his right. “We were going north at the end,\\nand that means east is that way.”\\n“There it is,” Thom said abruptly. He pointed through the tangled branches to their left, straight\\nat the red star. Mat mumbled something under his breath.\\nOut of the corner of his eye Rand caught the movement as a Trolloc leaped out from behind a\\ntree without a sound, swinging its catchpole.

Half a step gained, and the catchpoles could drag them both out of their\\nsaddles.\\nHe leaned low on the gray’s neck to put that much more distance between his own neck and the\\nnooses.

Had\\nthe gleeman decided he was better off on his own, since all three Trollocs had fastened on the boys?\\nSuddenly Thom’s gelding galloped out of the night, hard behind the Trollocs. The Trollocs had\\nonly time enough to look back in surprise before the gleeman’s hands whipped back and then forward.\\nMoonlight flashed off steel. One Trolloc tumbled forward, rolling over and over before landing in a\\nheap, while a second dropped to its knees with a scream, clawing at its back with both hands. The\\nthird snarled, baring a muzzleful of sharp teeth, but as its companions toppled it whirled away into the\\ndarkness.

I hope the river isn’t too far. I hope. . . .” Instead of saying what else he\\nhoped, he shook his head and set off at a quick canter. Rand and Mat fell in behind him.\\nSoon they reached a low bank where trees grew right to the edge of the night-black water, its\\nmoon-streaked surface riffled by the wind. Rand could not see the far side at all. He did not like the\\nidea of crossing on a raft in the dark, but he liked the idea of staying on this side even less. \\nI’ll swim\\nif I have to.\\nSomewhere away from the river a Trolloc horn brayed, sharp, quick, and urgent in the darkness.\\nIt was the first sound from the horns since they had left the ruins. Rand wondered if it meant some of\\nthe others had been captured.\\n“No use staying here all night,” Thom said. “Pick a direction. Upriver, or down?”\\n“But Moiraine and the others could be anywhere,” Mat protested. “Any way we choose could\\njust take us further away.”\\n“So it could.” Clucking to his gelding, Thom turned downriver, heading along the bank. “So it\\ncould.” Rand looked at Mat, who shrugged, and they turned after him.\\nFor a time nothing changed. The bank was higher in some places, lower in others, the trees grew\\nthicker, or thinned out in small clearings, but the night and the river and the wind were all the same,\\ncold and black. And no Trollocs. That was one change Rand was glad to forgo.\\nThen he saw a light ahead, just a single point. As they drew closer he could see that the light was\\nwell above the river, as if it were in a tree. Thom quickened the pace and began to hum under his\\nbreath.\\nFinally they could make out the source of the light, a lantern hoisted atop one of the masts of a\\nlarge trader’s boat, tied up for the night beside a small clearing in the trees. The boat, a good eighty\\nfeet long, shifted slightly with the current, tugging against the mooring ropes tied to trees. The rigging\\nhummed and creaked in the wind. The lantern doubled the moonlight on the deck, but no one was in\\nsight.\\n“Now that,” Thom said as he dismounted, “is better than an Aes Sedai’s raft, isn’t it?” He stood\\nwith his hands on his hips, and even in the dark his smugness was apparent. “It doesn’t look as if this\\nvessel is made to carry horses, but considering the danger he’s in, which we are going to warn him of,'),\n",

Into the clearing burst two Trollocs, howling\\nand waving their catchpoles, with four more right behind. The horses reared and whinnied. Shouts in\\nthe distance said more Trollocs were on the way.\\n“Onto the boat!” Thom shouted. “Quick! Leave all that! Run!” Suiting his own words, he ran for\\nthe boat, patches flapping and instrument cases on his back banging together. “You on the boat!” he\\nshouted. “Wake up, you fools! Trollocs!”\\nRand jerked his blanketroll and saddlebags free of the last thong and was right on the gleeman’s\\nheels. Tossing his burdens over the rail, he vaulted after them.

The boat lurched\\nand swung as if eager to be off. Up in the bow three men struggled with a Trolloc. Someone thrust\\nover the side with a spear, though Rand could not see what he was stabbing at. A bowstring snapped,\\nand snapped again. The man Rand had stepped on scrabbled away from him on hands and knees, then\\nflung up his hands when he saw Rand looking at him.\\n“Spare me!” he cried. “Take whatever you want, take the boat, take everything, but spare me!”\\nSuddenly something slammed across Rand’s back, smashing him to the deck. His sword skittered\\naway from his outstretched hand. Openmouthed, gasping for a breath that would not come, he tried to\\nreach the sword. His muscles responded with agonized slowness; he writhed like a slug. The fellow\\nwho wanted to be spared gave one frightened, covetous look at the sword, then vanished into the\\nshadows.\\nPainfully Rand managed to look over his shoulder, and knew his luck had run out. A wolf-\\nmuzzled Trolloc stood balanced on the railing, staring down at him and holding the splintered end of\\nthe catchpole that had knocked the wind out of him. Rand struggled to reach the sword, to move, to get\\naway, but his arms and legs moved jerkily, and only half as he wanted. They wobbled and went in\\nodd directions. His chest felt as if it were strapped with iron bands; silver spots swam in his eyes.\\nFrantically he hunted for some way to escape. Time seemed to slow as the Trolloc raised the jagged\\npole as if to spear him with it. To Rand the creature appeared to be moving as if in a dream. He\\nwatched the thick arm go back; he could already feel the broken haft ripping through his spine, feel the\\npain of it tearing him open. He thought his lungs would burst. \\nI’m going to die! Light help me, I’m\\ngoing to . . . !\\n The Trolloc’s arm started forward, driving the splintered shaft, and Rand found the\\nbreath for one yell. “No!”\\nSuddenly the ship lurched, and a boom swung out of the shadows to catch the Trolloc across the\\nchest with a crunch of breaking bones, sweeping it over the side.\\nFor a moment Rand lay panting and staring up at the boom swinging back and forth above him.\\nThat has to have used up my luck,\\n he thought. \\nThere can’t be any more after that.'),\n",

Less.\\nFortune prick me, that place be on no road to Caemlyn from anywhere I ever heard tell of.”\\n“Now that is a story,” Thom said, and he straightaway began to unfold it.\\nAccording to Thom, he had been trapped by the winter snows in a mining town in the Mountains\\nof Mist beyond Baerlon. While there he heard legends of a treasure dating from the Trolloc Wars, in\\nthe lost ruin of a city called Aridhol. Now it just so happened that he had earlier learned the location\\nof Aridhol from a map given him many years ago by a dying friend in Illian whose life he had once\\nsaved, a man who expired breathing that the map would make Thom rich, which Thom never believed\\nuntil he heard the legends. When the snows melted enough, he set out with a few companions,\\nincluding his two would-be apprentices, and after a journey of many hardships they actually found the\\nruined city. But it turned out the treasure had belonged to one of the Dreadlords themselves, and\\nTrollocs had been sent to fetch it back to Shayol Ghul. Almost every danger they really had faced—\\nTrollocs, Myrddraal, Draghkar, Mordeth, Mashadar—assailed them at one point or another of the\\nstory, though the way Thom told it they all seemed to be aimed at him personally, and to have been\\nhandled by him with the greatest adroitness. With much derring-do, mostly by Thom, they escaped,\\npursued by Trollocs, though they became separated in the night, until finally Thom and his two\\ncompanions sought refuge on the last place left to them, Captain Domon’s most welcome ship.\\nAs the gleeman finished up, Rand realized his mouth had been hanging open for some time and\\nshut it with a click. When he looked at Mat, his friend was staring wide-eyed at the gleeman.\\nCaptain Domon drummed his fingers on the arm of his chair. “That be a tale many folk would no\\nbelieve. Of course, I did see the Trollocs, did I no.”\\n“Every word true,” Thom said blandly, “from one who lived it.”\\n“Happen you have some of this treasure with you?”\\nThom spread his hands regretfully. “Alas, what little we managed to carry away was with our\\nhorses, which bolted when those last Trollocs appeared. All I have left are my flute and my harp, a\\nfew coppers, and the clothes on my back. But believe me, you want no part of that treasure. It has the\\ntaint of the Dark One. Best to leave it to the ruins and the Trollocs.”\\n“So you’ve no money to pay your passage. I’d no let my own brother sail with me if he could no\\npay his passage, especially if he brought Trollocs behind him to hack up my railings and cut up my\\nrigging. Why should I no let you swim back where you came from, and be rid of you?”\\n“You wouldn’t just put us ashore?” Mat said. “Not with Trollocs there?”'),\n",

I need a good sword, and fine\\nfellow that I be, I’ll let you have passage far as Whitebridge for it.”\\nThom opened his mouth, and Rand spoke up quickly, “No!” Tam had not given it to him to trade\\naway.

He put the scales and the bag back\\nin the chest and closed it in a satisfied way. “Plus a bit for bringing Trollocs down on me so I must\\nrun downriver in the night when there be shallows aplenty to pile me up.”\\n“What about the others?” Rand asked. “Will you take them, too? They should have reached the\\nriver by now, or they soon will, and they’ll see that lantern on your mast.”\\nCaptain Domon’s eyebrows rose in surprise. “Happen you think we be standing still, man?\\nFortune prick me, we be three, four miles downriver from where you came aboard.

I’ve had my fill of Trollocs dogging\\nmy heels long before tonight, and I’ll have no more can I help it.”\\nThom leaned forward interestedly. “You have had encounters with Trollocs before? Lately?”\\nDomon hesitated, eyeing Thom narrowly, but when he spoke he merely sounded disgusted. “I\\nwintered in Saldaea, man. Not my choice, but the river froze early and the ice broke up late.

The smoke could mean Trollocs, but the only way to find out was to look. She tried\\nnot to think about the use Trollocs might be making of a fire.\\nCrouching, she slipped from tree to tree, mentally cursing the skirts she had to hold up out of the\\nway. Dresses were not made for stalking. The sound of a horse slowed her, and when she finally\\npeered cautiously around the trunk of an ash, the Warder was dismounting from his black warhorse in\\na small clearing on the bank. The Aes Sedai sat on a log beside a small fire where a kettle of water\\nwas just coming to a boil. Her white mare browsed behind her among sparse weeds. Nynaeve\\nremained where she was.\\n“They are all gone,” Lan announced grimly. “Four Halfmen started south about two hours before\\ndawn, as near as I can tell—they don’t leave much trace behind—but the Trollocs have vanished.\\nEven the corpses, and Trollocs are not known for carrying off their dead. Unless they’re hungry.”\\nMoiraine tossed a handful of something into the boiling water and moved the kettle from the fire.\\n“One could always hope they had gone back into Shadar Logoth and been consumed by it, but that\\nwould be too much to wish for.”\\nThe delicious odor of tea drifted to Nynaeve. \\nLight, don’t let my stomach grumble.\\n“There was no clear sign of the boys, or any of the others. The tracks are too muddled to tell\\nanything.” In her concealment, Nynaeve smiled; the Warder’s failure was a slight vindication of her\\nown. “But this other is important, Moiraine,” Lan went on, frowning. He waved away the Aes Sedai’s\\noffer of tea and began marching up and down in front of the fire, one hand on his sword hilt and his\\ncloak changing colors as he turned. “I could accept Trollocs in the Two Rivers, even a hundred\\nTrollocs. But this? There must have been almost a thousand in the hunt for us yesterday.”\\n“We were very lucky that not all stayed to search Shadar Logoth. The Myrddraal must have\\ndoubted we would hide there, but they also feared to return to Shayol Ghul leaving even the slightest\\nchance uncovered. The Dark One was never a lenient master.”\\n“Don’t try to evade it. You know what I am saying. If those thousand were here to be sent into'),\n",

The Borderlands could be overrun in a year.”\\n“The whole world will be overrun in five if we do not find those boys,” Moiraine said simply.\\n“The question worries me, also, but I have no answers. The Ways are closed, and there has not been\\nan Aes Sedai powerful enough to Travel since the Time of Madness.

I cannot. I dare not. You know how much is at stake. I must have those\\nyoung men. That Shayol Ghul will hunt them, I expect. Opposition from within the White Tower, even\\nfrom the Amyrlin Seat, I accept. There are always Aes Sedai who will accept only one solution.\\nBut. . . .” Suddenly she put her cup down and sat up straight, grimacing. “If you watch the wolf too\\nhard,” she muttered, “a mouse will bite you on the ankle.” And she looked right at the tree behind\\nwhich Nynaeve was hiding. “Mistress al’Meara, you may come out now, if you wish.”\\nNynaeve scrambled to her feet, hastily dusting dead leaves from her dress. Lan had spun to face\\nthe tree as soon as Moiraine’s eyes moved; his sword was in his hand before she finished speaking\\nNynaeve’s name. Now he sheathed it again with more force than was strictly necessary. His face was\\nalmost as expressionless as ever, but Nynaeve thought there was a touch of chagrin about the set of\\nhis mouth. She felt a stab of satisfaction; the Warder had not known she was there, at least.\\nSatisfaction lasted only a moment, though. She fastened her eyes on Moiraine and walked toward\\nher purposefully. She wanted to remain cold and calm, but her voice quivered with anger. “What have\\nyou meshed Egwene and the boys in? What filthy Aes Sedai plots are you planning to use them in?”\\nThe Aes Sedai picked up her cup and calmly sipped her tea. When Nynaeve was close, though,\\nLan put out an arm to bar her way. She tried to brush the obstruction aside, and was surprised when\\nthe Warder’s arm moved no more than an oak branch would have. She was not frail, but his muscles\\nwere like iron.\\n“Tea?” Moiraine offered.\\n“No, I don’t want any tea. I would not drink your tea if I was dying of thirst. You won’t use any\\nEmond’s Field folk in your dirty Aes Sedai schemes.”\\n“You have very little room to talk, Wisdom.” Moiraine showed more interest in her hot tea than\\nin anything she was saying. “You can wield the One Power yourself, after a fashion.”\\nNynaeve pushed at Lan’s arm again; it still did not move, and she decided to ignore it. “Why\\ndon’t you try claiming I am a Trolloc?”\\nMoiraine’s smile was so knowing that Nynaeve wanted to hit her. “Do you think I can stand\\nface-to-face with a woman who can touch the True Source and channel the One Power, even if only'),\n",

So what did I\\nsense, Nynaeve al’Meara, Wisdom of Emond’s Field and unknowing wielder of the One Power?”\\nLan was looking down at Nynaeve in a way she did not like; surprised and speculative, it\\nseemed to her, though nothing had changed about his face but his eyes.

They\\ntold me how wonderful her cures were, how she sometimes healed injuries, that should have been\\ncrippling, so well there was barely a scar, and not a limp or a twinge.

Oh, it has nothing to do with the wind, of course. It is of Air and Water.\\nIt is not something you needed to be taught; it was born into you, just as it was born into Egwene. But\\nyou have learned to handle it, which she still has to learn. Two minutes after I came face-to-face with\\nyou, I knew. Do you remember how I suddenly asked you if you were the Wisdom? Why, do you\\nthink? There was nothing to distinguish you from any other pretty young woman getting ready for\\nFestival. Even looking for a young Wisdom I expected someone half again your age.”\\nNynaeve remembered that meeting all too well; this woman, more self-possessed than anyone in\\nthe Women’s Circle, in a dress more beautiful than any she had ever seen, addressing her as a child.\\nThen Moiraine had suddenly blinked as if surprised and out of a clear sky asked. . . .\\nShe licked lips gone abruptly dry. They were both looking at her, the Warder’s face as\\nunreadable as a stone, the Aes Sedai’s sympathetic yet intent. Nynaeve shook her head. “No! No, it’s\\nimpossible. I would know. You are just trying to trick me, and it will not work.”\\n“Of course you do not know,” Moiraine said soothingly. “Why should you even suspect? All of\\nyour life you have heard about listening to the wind. In any case, you would as soon announce to all of\\nEmond’s Field that you were a Darkfriend as admit to yourself, even in the deepest recesses of your\\nmind, that you have anything to do with the One Power, or the dreaded Aes Sedai.” Amusement flitted\\nacross Moiraine’s face. “But I can tell you how it began.”\\n“I don’t want to hear any more of your lies,” she said, but the Aes Sedai went right on.\\n“Perhaps as much as eight or ten years ago—the age varies, but always comes young—there was\\nsomething you wanted more than anything else in the world, something you needed. And you got it. A\\nbranch suddenly falling where you could pull yourself out of a pond instead of drowning. A friend, or\\na pet, getting well when everyone thought they would die.\\n“You felt nothing special at the time, but a week or ten days later you had your first reaction to\\ntouching the True Source.

Do you\\nremember?”\\nNynaeve sat down hard on the ground; her legs would not hold her up. She remembered, but she\\nshook her head anyway. It had to be coincidence. Or else Moiraine had asked more questions in\\nEmond’s Field than she had thought. The Aes Sedai had asked a great many questions. It had to be\\nthat. Lan offered a hand, but she did not even see it.\\n“I will go further,” Moiraine said when Nynaeve kept silent. “You used the Power to Heal either\\nPerrin or Egwene at some time. An affinity develops. You can sense the presence of someone you\\nhave Healed. In Baerlon you came straight to the Stag and Lion, though it was not the nearest inn to\\nany gate by which you could have entered. Of the people from Emond’s Field, only Perrin and\\nEgwene were at the inn when you arrived. Was it Perrin, or Egwene? Or both?”\\n“Egwene,” Nynaeve mumbled. She had always taken it for granted that she could sometimes tell\\nwho was approaching her even when she could not see them; not until now had she realized that it\\nwas always someone on whom her cures had worked almost miraculously well. And she had always\\nknown when the medicine would work beyond expectations, always felt the certainty when she said\\nthe crops would be especially good, or that the rains would come early or late. That was the way she\\nthought it was supposed to be. Not all Wisdoms could listen to the wind, but the best could. That was\\nwhat Mistress Barran always said, just as she said Nynaeve would be one of the best.\\n“She had breakbone fever.” She kept her head down and spoke to the ground. “I was still\\napprentice to Mistress Barran, and she set me to watch Egwene. I was young, and I didn’t know the\\nWisdom had everything well in hand. It’s terrible to watch, breakbone fever. The child was soaked\\nwith sweat, groaning and twisting until I could not understand why I didn’t hear her bones snapping.\\nMistress Barran had told me the fever would break in another day, two at the most, but I thought she\\nwas doing me a kindness. I thought Egwene was dying. I used to look after her sometimes when she\\nwas a toddler—when her mother was busy—and I started crying because I was going to have to\\nwatch her die. When Mistress Barran came back an hour later, the fever had broken. She was\\nsurprised, but she made over me more than Egwene. I always thought she believed I had given the\\nchild something and was too frightened to admit it. I always thought she was trying to comfort me, to\\nmake sure I knew I hadn’t hurt Egwene. A week later I fell on the floor in her sitting room, shaking\\nand burning up by turns. She bundled me into bed, but by suppertime it was gone.”\\nShe dropped her head in her hands as she finished speaking. \\nThe Aes Sedai chose a good\\nexample,\\n she thought, \\nLight burn her! Using the Power like an Aes Sedai. A filthy, Darkfriend Aes\\nSedai!\\n“You were very lucky,” Moiraine said, and Nynaeve sat erect. Lan stepped back as if what they\\ntalked about was none of his business, and busied himself with Mandarb’s saddle, not even glancing\\nat them.\\n“Lucky!”\\n“You have managed a crude control over the Power, even if touching the True Source still\\ncomes at random. If you had not, it would have killed you eventually. As it will, in all probability,\\nkill Egwene if you manage to stop her from going to Tar Valon.”\\n“If I learned to control it. . . .” Nynaeve swallowed hard. It was like admitting all over again that\\nshe could do what the Aes Sedai said. “If I learned to control it, so can she.

It had\\nbeen a last stubborn effort to deny what was plain, and there was never any good in that, however\\nunpleasant it might be. Mistress Barran’s first apprentice had died the way the Aes Sedai said when\\nNynaeve was still playing with dolls, and there had been a young woman in Deven Ride only a few\\nyears ago. She had been a Wisdom’s apprentice, too, one who could listen to the wind.\\n“You have great potential, I think,” Moiraine continued. “With training you might become even\\nmore powerful than Egwene, and I believe she can become one of the most powerful Aes Sedai we\\nhave seen in centuries.”\\nNynaeve pushed herself back from the Aes Sedai as she would have from a viper. “No! I’ll have\\nnothing to do with—” \\nWith what? Myself?\\n She slumped, and her voice became hesitant. “I would ask\\nyou not to tell anyone about this. Please?” The word nearly stuck in her throat. She would rather\\nTrollocs had appeared than she had been forced to say please to this woman. But Moiraine only\\nnodded assent, and some of her spirit returned. “None of this explains what you want with Rand, and\\nMat, and Perrin.”\\n“The Dark One wants them,” Moiraine replied. “If the Dark One wants a thing, I oppose it. Can\\nthere be a simpler reason, or a better?” She finished her tea, watching Nynaeve over the rim of her\\ncup. “Lan, we must be going. South, I think. I fear the Wisdom will not be accompanying us.”\\nNynaeve’s mouth tightened at the way the Aes Sedai said “Wisdom”; it seemed to suggest she\\nwas turning her back on great things in favor of something petty. \\nShe doesn’t want me along.

It was the cedar needles, pricking him through his still-damp clothes, that finally\\npricked through his exhaustion as well. Deep in a dream of Emond’s Field, of working at Master\\nLuhhan’s forge, he opened his eyes and stared, uncomprehending, at the sweet-smelling branches\\ninterwoven over his face, sunlight trickling through.\\nMost of the branches fell away as he sat up in surprise, but some hung haphazardly from his\\nshoulders, and even his head, making him appear something like a tree himself. Emond’s Field faded\\nas memory rushed back, so vivid that for a moment the night before seemed more real than anything\\naround him now.\\nPanting, frantic, he scrabbled his axe out of the pile. He clutched it in both hands and peered\\naround cautiously, holding his breath. Nothing moved. The morning was cold and still. If there were\\nTrollocs on the east bank of the Arinelle, they were not moving, at least not close to him. Taking a\\ndeep, calming breath, he lowered the axe to his knees, and waited a moment for his heart to stop\\npounding.\\nThe small stand of evergreens surrounding him was the first shelter he had found last night. It\\nwas sparse enough to give little protection against watching eyes if he stood up. Plucking branches\\nfrom his head and shoulders, he pushed aside the rest of his prickly blanket, then crawled on hands\\nand knees to the edge of the copse. There he lay studying the riverbank and scratching where the\\nneedles had stabbed him.\\nThe cutting wind of the night before had faded to a silent breeze that barely rippled the surface of\\nthe water. The river ran by, calm and empty. And wide. Surely too wide and too deep for Fades to\\ncross. The far bank appeared a solid mass of trees as far as he could see upriver and down. Certainly\\nnothing moved in his view over there.\\nHe was not sure how he felt about that. Fades and Trollocs he could do without quite easily,\\neven on the other side of the river, but a whole list of worries would have vanished with the\\nappearance of the Aes Sedai, or the Warder, or, even better, any of his friends. \\nIf wishes were wings,\\nsheep would fly.\\n That was what Mistress Luhhan always said.\\nHe had not seen a sign of his horse since riding over the bluff—he hoped it had swum out of the\\nriver safely—but he was more used to walking than riding anyway, and his boots were stout and well\\nsoled. He had nothing to eat, but his sling was still wrapped around his waist, and that or the\\nsnarelines in his pocket ought to yield a rabbit in a little time.

If the day was not\\nprecisely cold, it was not even close to warm.\\nTime was the problem, he thought with a sigh. Dry clothes, with a little time. A rabbit to roast\\nand a fire to roast it over, with a little time. His stomach rumbled, and he tried to forget about eating\\naltogether. There were more important uses for that time.

So he watched carefully from behind the trees and ran from one hiding place to the\\nnext, fast and low.\\nHe covered several miles that way, in spurts, until suddenly, halfway to the beckoning shelter of\\na growth of willows, he grunted and stopped dead, staring at the ground. Patches of bare earth spotted\\nthe matted brown of last year’s grass, and in the middle of one of those patches, right under his nose,\\nwas a clear hoofprint. A slow smile spread across his face. Some Trollocs had hooves, but he\\ndoubted if any wore horseshoes, especially horseshoes with the double crossbar Master Luhhan\\nadded for strength.\\nForgetting possible eyes on the other side of the river, he cast about for more tracks. The plaited\\ncarpet of dead grass did not take impressions well, but his sharp eyes found them anyway. The scanty\\ntrail led him straight away from the river to a dense stand of trees, thick with leatherleaf and cedar\\nthat made a wall against wind or prying eyes. The spreading branches of a lone hemlock towered in\\nthe middle of it all.\\nStill grinning, he pushed his way through the interwoven branches, not caring how much noise he\\nmade.

Here, sit by the fire and warm yourself. You lost your horse, didn’t you?”\\nHe let her push him to a place by the fire and rubbed his hands over the flames, grateful for the\\nwarmth. She produced an oiled paper packet from her saddlebags and gave him some bread and\\ncheese. The package had been so tightly wrapped that even after its dunking the food was dry. \\nHere\\nyou were worrying about her, and she’s done better than you did.\\n“Bela got me across,” Egwene said, patting the shaggy mare. “She headed away from the'),\n",

Regretfully eyeing the packet that she was rewrapping, he\\nlicked the last crumbs from his fingers before speaking. “I’ve seen no one but you since last night. No\\nFades or Trollocs, either; there’s that.”\\n“Rand has to be all right,” Egwene said, quickly adding, “they all do. They have to. They’re\\nprobably looking for us right now. They might find us anytime now. Moiraine is an Aes Sedai, after\\nall.”\\n“I keep being reminded of that,” he said. “Burn me, I wish I could forget.”\\n“I did not hear you complaining when she stopped the Trollocs from catching us,” Egwene said\\ntartly.\\n“I just wish we could do without her.” He shrugged uncomfortably under her steady gaze. “I\\nsuppose we can’t, though. I’ve been thinking.” Her eyebrows rose, but he was used to surprise\\nwhenever he claimed an idea. Even when his ideas were as good as theirs, they always remembered\\nhow deliberate he was in thinking of them. “We can wait for Lan and Moiraine to find us.”\\n“Of course,” she cut in. “Moiraine Sedai said she would find us if we were separated.”\\nHe let her finish, then went on. “Or the Trollocs could find us, first. Moiraine could be dead,\\ntoo. All of them could be. No, Egwene. I’m sorry, but they could be. I hope they are all safe. I hope\\nthey’ll walk up to this fire any minute. But hope is like a piece of string when you’re drowning; it just\\nisn’t enough to get you out by itself.”\\nEgwene closed her mouth and stared at him with her jaw set. Finally, she said, “You want to go\\ndownriver to Whitebridge? If Moiraine Sedai doesn’t find us here, that’s where she will look next.”\\n“I suppose,” he said slowly, “that Whitebridge is where we \\nshould\\n go. But the Fades probably\\nknow that, too. That’s where they’ll be looking, and this time we don’t have an Aes Sedai or a\\nWarder to protect us.”\\n“I suppose you’re going to suggest running off somewhere, the way Mat wanted to? Hiding\\nsomewhere the Fades and Trollocs won’t find us? Or Moiraine Sedai, either?”\\n“Don’t think I haven’t considered it,” he said quietly. “But every time we think we are free,\\nFades and Trollocs find us again. I don’t know if there \\nis\\n anyplace we could hide from them. I don’t\\nlike it much, but we need Moiraine.”\\n“I don’t understand then, Perrin. Where do we go?”\\nHe blinked in surprise. She was waiting for his answer. Waiting for \\nhim\\n to tell her what to do. It\\nhad never occurred to him that she would look to him to take the lead. Egwene never liked doing what\\nsomeone else had planned out, and she never let anybody tell her what to do. Except maybe the\\nWisdom, and he thought sometimes she balked at that. He smoothed the dirt in front of him with his\\nhand and cleared his throat roughly.\\n“If this is where we are now, and that is Whitebridge,” he stabbed the ground twice with his\\nfinger, “then Caemlyn should be somewhere around here.” He made a third mark, off to the side.\\nHe paused, looking at the three dots in the dirt. His entire plan was based on what he\\nremembered of her father’s old map. Master al’Vere said it was not too accurate, and, anyway, he had\\nnever mooned over it as much as Rand and Mat. But Egwene said nothing. When he looked up, she\\nwas still watching him with her hands in her lap.\\n“Caemlyn?” She sounded stunned.\\n“Caemlyn.” He drew a line in the dirt between two of the dots. “Away from the river, and\\nstraight across.

And when you walk till your feet\\nare ready to fall off, you’ll expect me to look after you.”\\n“Let it be,” he breathed when she looked like going on. “Anyway, you’ll take the first turn.” Her\\nface turned even more stubborn, but he refused to let her get a word in edgewise. “If you won’t get in\\nthe saddle by yourself, I’ll put you there.”\\nShe gave him a startled look, and a small smile curved her lips. “In that case. . . .” She sounded\\nas if she were about to laugh, but she climbed up.\\nHe grumbled to himself as he turned away from the river. Leaders in stories never had to put up\\nwith this sort of thing.\\nEgwene did insist on him taking his turns, and whenever he tried to avoid it, she bullied him into\\nthe saddle. Blacksmithing did not lend itself to a slender build, and Bela was not very large as horses\\nwent. Every time he put his foot in the stirrup the shaggy mare looked at him with what he was sure\\nwas reproach. Small things, perhaps, but they irritated. Soon he flinched whenever Egwene\\nannounced, “It’s your turn, Perrin.”\\nIn stories leaders seldom flinched, and they were never bullied. But, he reflected, they never had\\nto deal with Egwene, either.\\nThere were only short rations of bread and cheese to begin with, and what there was gave out by\\nthe end of the first day. Perrin set snares along likely rabbit runs—they looked old, but it was worth a\\nchance—while Egwene began laying a fire. When he was done, he decided to try his hand with his\\nsling before the light failed altogether. They had not seen a sign of anything at all alive, but. . . . To his\\nsurprise, he jumped a scrawny rabbit almost at once. He was so surprised when it burst from under a\\nbush right beneath his feet that it almost got away, but he fetched it at forty paces, just as it was\\ndarting around a tree.\\nWhen he came back to the camp with the rabbit, Egwene had broken limbs all laid for the fire,\\nbut she was kneeling beside the pile with her eyes closed. “What are you doing?

Her eyes dared\\nhim to say a word, and he wisely kept his mouth shut.\\nAfter that one hot meal, they subsisted on coarse wild tubers and a few young shoots. With still\\nno sign of spring, none of it was plentiful, and none of it tasty, either. Neither complained, but not a\\nmeal passed without one or the other sighing regretfully, and they both knew it was for the tang of a\\nbit of cheese, or even the smell of bread. A find of mushrooms—Queen’s Crowns, the best—one\\nafternoon in a shady part of the forest was enough to seem a great treat.

The forest had long swallowed it; trees grew right through everything, and\\nspiderwebs of old creeper enveloped the big stone blocks. Another time they came on a stone tower,\\nbroken-topped and brown with old moss, leaning on the huge oak whose thick roots were slowly\\ntoppling it. But they found no place where men had breathed in living remembrance. Memories of\\nShadar Logoth kept them away from the ruins and hurried their footsteps until they were once more\\ndeep in places that seemed never to have known a human footstep.\\nDreams plagued Perrin’s sleep, fearful dreams. Ba’alzamon was in them, chasing him through\\nmazes, hunting him, but Perrin never met him face-to-face, so far as he remembered. And their journey\\nhad been enough to bring a few bad dreams. Egwene complained of nightmares about Shadar Logoth,\\nespecially the two nights after they found the ruined fort and the abandoned tower. Perrin kept his\\nown counsel even when he woke sweating and shaking in the dark. She was looking to him to lead\\nthem safely to Caemlyn, not share worries about which they could do nothing.\\nHe was walking at Bela’s head, wondering if they would find anything to eat this evening, when\\nhe first caught the smell. The mare flared her nostrils and swung her head in the next moment. He\\nseized her bridle before she could whicker.\\n“That’s smoke,” Egwene said excitedly. She leaned forward in the saddle, drew a deep breath.\\n“A cookfire. Somebody is roasting dinner. Rabbit.”\\n“Maybe,” Perrin said cautiously, and her eager smile faded. He exchanged his sling for the\\nwicked half-moon of the axe. His hands opened and closed uncertainly on the thick haft. It was a\\nweapon, but neither his hidden practice behind the forge nor Lan’s teachings had really prepared him\\nto use it as one. Even the battle before Shadar Logoth was too vague in his mind to give him any\\nconfidence. He could never quite manage that void that Rand and the Warder talked about, either.\\nSunlight slanted through the trees behind them, and the forest was a still mass of dappled\\nshadows. The faint smell of woodsmoke drifted around them, tinged with the aroma of cooking meat.\\nIt could be rabbit\\n, he thought, and his stomach grumbled. And it could be something else, he\\nreminded himself. He looked at Egwene; she was watching him. There were responsibilities to being\\nleader.\\n“Wait here,” he said softly. She frowned, but he cut her off as she opened her mouth. “And be\\nquiet! We don’t know who it is, yet.” She nodded. Reluctantly, but she did it. Perrin wondered why\\nthat did not work when he was trying to make her take his turn riding. Drawing a deep breath, he\\nstarted for the source of the smoke.\\nHe had not spent as much time in the forests around Emond’s Field as Rand or Mat, but still he\\nhad done his share of hunting rabbits. He crept from tree to tree without so much as snapping a twig. It\\nwas not long before he was peering around the bole of a tall oak with spreading, serpentine limbs that\\nbent to touch the ground then rose again. Beyond lay a campfire, and a lean, sun-browned man was\\nleaning against one of the limbs not far from the flames.\\nAt least he was not a Trolloc, but he was the strangest fellow Perrin had ever seen. For one\\nthing, his clothes all seemed to be made from animal skins, with the fur still on, even his boots and the\\nodd, flat-topped round cap on his head. His cloak was a crazy quilt of rabbit and squirrel; his trousers\\nappeared to be made from the long-haired hide of a brown and white goat. Gathered at the back of his\\nneck with a cord, his graying brown hair hung to his waist. A thick beard fanned across half his chest.\\nA long knife hung at his belt, almost a sword, and a bow and quiver stood propped against a limb\\nclose to hand.\\nThe man leaned back with his eyes closed, apparently asleep, but Perrin did not stir from his\\nconcealment. Six sticks slanted over the fellow’s fire, and on each stick a rabbit was skewered,'),\n",

The smell of them, so close,\\nmade his mouth water.\\n“You done drooling?” The man opened one eye and cocked it at Perrin’s hiding place. “You and\\nyour friend might as well sit and have a bite. I haven’t seen you eat much the last couple of days.”\\nPerrin hesitated, then stood slowly, still gripping his axe tightly. “You’ve been watching me for\\ntwo days?”\\nThe man chuckled deep in his throat. “Yes, I been watching you. And that pretty girl. Pushes you\\naround like a bantam rooster, doesn’t she? Heard you, mostly. The horse is the only one of you\\ndoesn’t trample around loud enough to be heard five miles off. You going to ask her in, or are you\\nintending to eat all the rabbit yourself?”\\nPerrin bristled; he knew he did not make much noise. You could not get close enough to a rabbit\\nin the Waterwood to fetch it with a sling if you made noise. But the smell of rabbit made him\\nremember that Egwene was hungry, too, not to mention waiting to discover if it was a Trolloc fire\\nthey had smelled.\\nHe slipped the haft of his axe through the belt loop and raised his voice. “Egwene! It’s all right!\\nIt \\nis\\n rabbit!” Offering his hand, he added in a more normal tone, “My name is Perrin. Perrin Aybara.”\\nThe man considered his hand before taking it awkwardly, as if unused to shaking hands. “I’m\\ncalled Elyas,” he said, looking up. “Elyas Machera.”\\nPerrin gasped, and nearly dropped Elyas’s hand. The man’s eyes were yellow, like bright,\\npolished gold. Some memory tickled at the back of Perrin’s mind, then fled. All he could think of right\\nthen was that all of the Trollocs’ eyes he had seen had been almost black.\\nEgwene appeared, cautiously leading Bela. She tied the mare’s reins to one of the smaller\\nbranches of the oak, and made polite sounds when Perrin introduced her to Elyas, but her eyes kept\\ndrifting to the rabbits. She did not seem to notice the man’s eyes. When Elyas motioned them to the\\nfood, she fell to with a will. Perrin hesitated only a minute longer before joining her.\\nElyas waited silently while they ate. Perrin was so hungry he tore off pieces of meat so hot he\\nhad to juggle them from hand to hand before he could hold them in his mouth. Even Egwene showed\\nlittle of her usual neatness; greasy juice ran down her chin. Day faded into twilight before they began\\nto slow down, moonless darkness closing in around the fire, and then Elyas spoke.\\n“What are you doing out here? There isn’t a house inside fifty miles in any direction.”\\n“We’re going to Caemlyn,” Egwene said. “Perhaps you could—” Her eyebrows lifted coolly as\\nElyas threw back his head and roared with laughter. Perrin stared at him, a rabbit leg half raised to\\nhis mouth.\\n“Caemlyn?” Elyas wheezed when he could talk again. “The path you’re following, the line\\nyou’ve taken the last two days, you’ll pass a hundred miles or more north of Caemlyn.”\\n“We were going to ask directions,” Egwene said defensively. “We just haven’t found any\\nvillages or farms, yet.”\\n“And none you will,” Elyas said, chuckling. “The way you’re going, you can travel all the way\\nto the Spine of the World without seeing another human. Of course, if you managed to climb the Spine\\n—it can be done, some places—you could find people in the Aiel Waste, but you wouldn’t like it\\nthere. You’d broil by day, and freeze by night, and die of thirst anytime. It takes an Aielman to find\\nwater in the Waste, and they don’t like strangers much.

Raising his head, he replaced his round fur cap, which had fallen off\\nwhile he was rolling about, and stared at her from under lowered brows. “I don’t much like people,”\\nhe said in a flat voice. “Cities are full of people. I don’t go near villages, or even farms, very often.\\nVillagers, farmers, they don’t like my friends.

Perrin half rose as\\nshapes appeared all around them in the darkening forest. Bela reared and twisted, screaming.\\n“Quiet the mare,” Elyas said. “They won’t hurt her. Or you, if you’re still.”\\nFour wolves stepped into the firelight, shaggy, waist-high forms with jaws that could break a\\nman’s leg.

He had the feeling that all the wolves,\\nthose in the trees, as well, were staring at him. It made his skin itch. Cautiously he moved his hands\\naway from the axe. He imagined he could feel the tension ease among the wolves. Slowly he sat back\\ndown; his hands shook until he gripped his knees to stop them. Egwene was so stiff she almost\\nquivered. One wolf, close to black with a lighter gray patch on his face, lay nearly touching her.\\nBela had ceased her screaming and rearing. Instead she stood trembling and shifting in an\\nattempt to keep all of the wolves in view, kicking occasionally to show the wolves that she could,\\nintending to sell her life dearly. The wolves seemed to ignore her and everyone else. Tongues lolling\\nout of their mouths, they waited at their ease.\\n“There,” Elyas said. “That’s better.”\\n“Are they tame?” Egwene asked faintly, and hopefully, too. “They’re . . . pets?”\\nElyas snorted. “Wolves don’t tame, girl, not even as well as men. They’re my friends. We keep\\neach other company, hunt together, converse, after a fashion. Just like any friends. Isn’t that right,\\nDapple?” A wolf with fur that faded through a dozen shades of gray, dark and light, turned her head to\\nlook at him.\\n“You talk to them?” Perrin marveled.\\n“It isn’t exactly talking,” Elyas replied slowly. “The words don’t matter, and they aren’t exactly\\nright, either. Her name isn’t Dapple. It’s something that means the way shadows play on a forest pool\\nat a midwinter dawn, with the breeze rippling the surface, and the tang of ice when the water touches\\nthe tongue, and a hint of snow before nightfall in the air. But that isn’t quite it, either. You can’t say it\\nin words. It’s more of a feeling. That’s the way wolves talk. The others are Burn, Hopper, and\\nWind.” Burn had an old scar on his shoulder that might explain his name, but there was nothing about\\nthe other two wolves to give any indication of what their names might mean.\\nFor all the man’s gruffness, Perrin thought Elyas was pleased to have the chance to talk to\\nanother human. He seemed eager enough to do it, at least. Perrin eyed the wolves’ teeth glistening in\\nthe firelight and thought it might be a good idea to keep him talking. “How . . . how did you learn to'),\n",

That’s always the way of it, I understand.\\nThe wolves find you, not you them. Some people thought me touched by the Dark One, because\\nwolves started appearing wherever I went. I suppose I thought so, too, sometimes. Most decent folk\\nbegan to avoid me, and the ones who sought me out weren’t the kind I wanted to know, one way or\\nanother. Then I noticed there were times when the wolves seemed to know what I was thinking, to\\nrespond to what was in my head. That was the real beginning. They were curious about me. Wolves\\ncan sense people, usually, but not like this. They were glad to find me. They say it’s been a long time\\nsince they hunted with men, and when they say a long time, the feeling I get is like a cold wind\\nhowling all the way down from the First Day.”\\n“I never heard of men hunting with wolves,” Egwene said. Her voice was not entirely steady,\\nbut the fact that the wolves were just lying there seemed to give her heart.\\nIf Elyas heard her, he gave no sign. “Wolves remember things differently from the way people\\ndo,” he said. His strange eyes took on a faraway look, as if he were drifting off on the flow of\\nmemory himself. “Every wolf remembers the history of all wolves, or at least the shape of it. Like I\\nsaid, it can’t be put into words very well. They remember running down prey side-by-side with men,\\nbut it was so long ago that it’s more like the shadow of a shadow than a memory.”\\n“That’s very interesting,” Egwene said, and Elyas looked at her sharply. “No, I mean it. It is.”\\nShe wet her lips. “Could . . . ah . . . could you teach us to talk to them?”\\nElyas snorted again. “It can’t be taught. Some can do it, some can’t. They say he can.” He\\npointed at Perrin.\\nPerrin looked at Elyas’s finger as if it were a knife. \\nHe really is a madman\\n. The wolves were\\nstaring at him again. He shifted uncomfortably.\\n“You say you’re going to Caemlyn,” Elyas said, “but that still doesn’t explain what you’re doing\\nout here, days from anywhere.” He tossed back his fur-patch cloak and lay down on his side, propped\\non one elbow and waiting expectantly.\\nPerrin glanced at Egwene. Early on they had concocted a story for when they found people, to\\nexplain where they were going without bringing them any trouble. Without letting anyone know where\\nthey were really from, or where they were really going, eventually. Who knew what careless word\\nmight reach a Fade’s ear? They had worked on it every day, patching it together, honing out flaws.\\nAnd they had decided Egwene was the one to tell it. She was better with words than he was, and she\\nclaimed she could always tell when he was lying by his face.\\nEgwene began at once, smoothly. They were from the north, from Saldaea, from farms outside a\\ntiny village. Neither of them had been more than twenty miles from home in their whole lives before\\nthis. But they had heard gleemen’s stories, and merchants’ tales, and they wanted to see some of the\\nworld. Caemlyn, and Illian. The Sea of Storms, and maybe even the fabled islands of the Sea Folk.\\nPerrin listened with satisfaction. Not even Thom Merrilin could have made a better tale from the\\nlittle they knew of the world outside the Two Rivers, or one better suited to their needs.\\n“From Saldaea, eh?” Elyas said when she was done.\\nPerrin nodded. “That’s right. We thought about seeing Maradon first. I’d surely like to see the\\nKing. But the capital city would be the first place our fathers would look.”\\nThat was his part of it, to make it plain they had never been to Maradon.

Elyas\\nwent on in a conversational tone. “Dapple says she smelled Halfmen and Trollocs in your minds\\nwhile you were telling that fool story. They all did. You’re mixed up with Trollocs, somehow, and\\nthe Eyeless. Wolves hate Trollocs and Halfmen worse than wildfire, worse than anything, and so do\\nI.\\n“Burn wants to be done with you. It was Trollocs gave him that mark when he was a yearling.\\nHe says game is scarce, and you’re fatter than any deer he’s seen in months, and we should be done\\nwith you.

The menacing rumble filled the night.\\n“All right,” Perrin said quickly. “All right!” The growling cut off, sharp and sudden. Egwene\\nunclenched her hands and nodded. “It all started a few days before Winternight,” Perrin began, “when\\nour friend Mat saw a man in a black cloak. . . .”\\nElyas never changed his expression or the way he lay on his side, but there was something about\\nthe tilt of his head that spoke of ears pricking up. The four wolves sat down as Perrin went on; he had\\nthe impression they were listening, too. The story was a long one, and he told almost all of it. The\\ndream he and the others had had in Baerlon, though, he kept to himself. He waited for the wolves to\\nmake some sign they had caught the omission, but they only watched.

We’ve had Trollocs chasing us, and Fades, and Draghkar.\\nEverything but Darkfriends. We can’t hide, and we can’t fight back alone. So who is going to help us?\\nWho else is strong enough, except Aes Sedai?”\\nElyas was silent for a time, looking at the wolves, most often at Dapple or Burn.

Even if it had nothing to do with the Power, he\\nwanted no part of it. \\nHe\\n had \\nto be making some crazy joke. I can’t talk to wolves\\n. One of the wolves\\n—Hopper, he thought—looked at him and seemed to grin. He wondered how he had put a name to\\nhim.\\n“You could stay with me,” Elyas said finally. “With us.” Egwene’s eyebrows shot up, and\\nPerrin’s mouth dropped open. “Well, what could be safer?” Elyas challenged. “Trollocs will take\\nany chance they get to kill a wolf by itself, but they’ll go miles out of their way to avoid a pack. And\\nyou won’t have to worry about Aes Sedai, either. They don’t often come into these woods.”\\n“I don’t know.” Perrin avoided looking at the wolves to either side of him. One was Dapple, and\\nhe could feel her eyes on him. “For one thing, it isn’t just the Trollocs.”\\nElyas chuckled coldly. “I’ve seen a pack pull down one of the Eyeless, too. Lost half the pack,\\nbut they wouldn’t give up once they had its scent. Trollocs, Myrddraal, it’s all one to the wolves. It’s\\nyou they really want, boy. They’ve heard of other men who can talk to wolves, but you’re the first\\nthey’ve ever met besides me. They’ll accept your friend, too, though, and you’ll all be safer here than\\nin any city.

Play the goat, if you’ve a mind to. Don’t you want to be safe?”\\n“I’m not deceiving myself. There’s nothing to deceive myself about. All we want—”\\n“We are going to Caemlyn,” Egwene spoke up firmly. “And then to Tar Valon.”\\nClosing his mouth, Perrin met her angry look with one of his own. He knew that she followed his\\nlead when she wanted to and not when she did not, but she could at least let him answer for himself.\\n“What about you, Perrin?” he said, and answered himself. “Me?

There were stone bridges and railless ramps everywhere, all sprouting off from broad, flat-\\ntopped stone spires, all polished and smooth and streaked with red and gold. Level on level, the maze\\nstretched up and down through the murk, without any apparent beginning or end. Every bridge led to a\\nspire, every ramp to another spire, other bridges. Whatever direction Rand looked, as far as his eye\\ncould make out in the dimness it was the same, above as well as below. There was not enough light to\\nsee clearly, and he was almost glad of it. Some of those ramps led to platforms that had to be directly\\nabove the ones below. He could not see the base of any of them. He pressed, seeking freedom,\\nknowing it was an illusion. Everything was illusion.\\nHe knew the illusion; he had followed it too many times not to know. However far he went, up\\nor down or in any direction, there was only the shiny stone. Stone, but the dankness of deep, fresh-\\nturned earth permeated the air, and the sickly sweetness of decay. The smell of a grave opened out of\\nits time. He tried not to breathe, but the smell filled his nostrils. It clung to his skin like oil.\\nA flicker of motion caught his eye, and he froze where he was, half crouched against the\\npolished guardwall around one of the spire tops. It was no hiding place. From a thousand places a\\nwatcher could have seen him. Shadow filled the air, but there were no deeper shadows in which to\\nhide. The light did not come from lamps, or lanterns, or torches; it was simply there, such as it was,\\nas if it seeped out of the air. Enough by which to see, after a fashion; enough by which to be seen. But\\nstillness gave a little protection.\\nThe movement came again, and now it was clear. A man striding up a distant ramp, careless of\\nthe lack of railings and the drop to nothing below. The man’s cloak rippled with his stately haste, and\\nhis head turned, searching, searching. The distance was too far for Rand to see more than the shape in\\nthe murk, but he did not need to be closer to know the cloak was the red of fresh blood, that the\\nsearching eyes blazed like two furnaces.\\nHe tried tracing the maze with his eyes, to see how many connections Ba’alzamon needed before\\nreaching him, then gave it up as useless. Distances were deceiving here, another lesson he had\\nlearned. What seemed far away might be reached by turning a corner; what appeared close could be\\nout of reach altogether. The only thing to do, as it had been from the beginning, was to keep moving.\\nKeep moving, and not think. Thinking was dangerous, he knew.\\nYet, as he turned away from Ba’alzamon’s distant form, he could not help wondering about Mat.\\nWas Mat somewhere in this maze? \\nOr are there two mazes, two Ba’alzamons?\\n His mind skittered\\naway from that; it was too dreadful to dwell on. \\nIs this like Baerlon?

Blood and ashes, where’s the comfort in it?\\nThere had been two or three close brushes, though he could not remember them clearly, but for a\\nlong, long time—how long?—he had run while Ba’alzamon vainly pursued. Was this like Baerlon, or\\nwas it only a nightmare, only a dream like other men’s dreams?\\nFor an instant, then—just for the length of time it took to take a breath—he knew why it was\\ndangerous to think, what it was dangerous to think about. As it had before, every time he allowed\\nhimself to think of what surrounded him as a dream, the air shimmered, clouding his eyes. It turned to\\njell, holding him. Just for an instant.\\nThe gritty heat prickled his skin, and his throat had long since gone dry as he trotted down the\\nthorn-hedge maze. How long had it been now? His sweat evaporated before it had a chance to bead,\\nand his eyes burned. Overhead—and not too far overhead, at that—boiled furious, steely clouds\\nstreaked with black, but not a breath of air stirred in the maze. For a moment he thought it had been\\ndifferent, but the thought evaporated in the heat. He had been here a long time. It was dangerous to\\nthink, he knew that.\\nSmooth stones, pale and rounded, made a sketchy pavement, half buried in the bone-dry dust that\\nrose in puffs at even his lightest step. It tickled his nose, threatening a sneeze that might give him\\naway; when he tried to breathe through his mouth, dust clogged his throat until he choked.\\nThis was a dangerous place; he knew that, too. Ahead of him he could see three openings in the\\nhigh wall of thorns, then the way curved out of sight. Ba’alzamon could be approaching any one of\\nthose corners at that very moment. There had been two or three encounters already, though he could\\nnot remember much beyond that they had happened and he had escaped . . . somehow. Dangerous to\\nthink too much.\\nPanting in the heat, he stopped to examine the maze wall. Thickly woven thorn bushes, brown\\nand dead-looking, with cruel black thorns like inch-long hooks. Too tall to see over, too dense to see\\nthrough. Gingerly he touched the wall, and gasped. Despite all his care, a thorn pierced his finger,\\nburning like a hot needle. He stumbled back, his heels catching on the stones, shaking his hand and\\nscattering thick drops of blood. The burn began to subside, but his whole hand throbbed.\\nAbruptly he forgot the pain. His heel had overturned one of the smooth stones, kicked it out of\\nthe dry ground. He stared at it, and empty eye sockets stared back. A skull. A human skull. He looked\\nalong the pathway at all the smooth, pale stones, all exactly alike. He shifted his feet hastily, but he\\ncould not move without walking on them, and he could not stay still without standing on them. A stray\\nthought took vague shape, that things might not be what they seemed, but he pushed it down ruthlessly.\\nThinking was dangerous here.\\nHe took a shaky hold on himself. Staying in one place was dangerous, too. That was one of the\\nthings he knew dimly but with certainty. The flow of blood from his finger had dwindled to a slow\\ndrip, and the throb was almost gone. Sucking his fingertip, he started down the path in the direction he\\nhappened to be facing. One way was as good as another in here.\\nNow he remembered hearing once that you could get out of a maze by always turning in the same\\ndirection. At the first opening in the wall of thorns he turned right, then right again at the next. And\\nfound himself face-to-face with Ba’alzamon.\\nSurprise flitted across Ba’alzamon’s face, and his blood-red cloak settled as he stopped short.\\nFlames soared in his eyes, but in the heat of the maze Rand barely felt them.\\n“How long do you think you can evade me, boy?

You are my\\nhound, and if you will not course at my command, I will strangle you with the corpse of the Great\\nSerpent!”\\nBa’alzamon stretched out his hand, and suddenly Rand knew a way to escape, a misty, half-\\nformed memory that screamed danger, but nothing to the danger of being touched by the Dark One.\\n“A dream!” Rand shouted. “This is a dream!”\\nBa’alzamon’s eyes began to widen, in surprise or anger or both, then the air shimmered, and his\\nfeatures blurred, and faded.\\nRand turned about in one spot, staring. Staring at his own image thrown back at him a\\nthousandfold. Ten thousandfold. Above was blackness, and blackness below, but all around him\\nstood mirrors, mirrors set at every angle, mirrors as far as he could see, all showing him, crouched\\nand turning, staring wide-eyed and frightened.\\nA red blur drifted across the mirrors. He spun, trying to catch it, but in every mirror it drifted\\nbehind his own image and vanished. Then it was back again, but not as a blur. Ba’alzamon strode\\nacross the mirrors, ten thousand Ba’alzamons, searching, crossing and recrossing the silvery mirrors.\\nHe found himself staring at the reflection of his own face, pale and shivering in the knife-edge\\ncold. Ba’alzamon’s image grew behind his, staring at him; not seeing, but staring still. In every\\nmirror, the flames of Ba’alzamon’s face raged behind him, enveloping, consuming, merging. He\\nwanted to scream, but his throat was frozen. There was only one face in those endless mirrors. His\\nown face. Ba’alzamon’s face. One face.\\n \\nRand jerked, and opened his eyes. Darkness, lessened only slightly by a pale light. Barely\\nbreathing, he moved nothing except his eyes. A rough wool blanket covered him to his shoulders, and\\nhis head was cradled on his arms. He could feel smooth wooden planks under his hands. Deck planks.\\nRigging creaked in the night. He let out a long breath. He was on the \\nSpray\\n. It was over . . . for\\nanother night, at least.\\nWithout thinking he put his finger in his mouth. At the taste of blood, he stopped breathing.\\nSlowly he put his hand close to his face, to where he could see in the dim moonlight, to where he\\ncould watch the bead of blood form on his fingertip. Blood from the prick of a thorn.\\n \\nThe \\nSpray\\n made haste slowly down the Arinelle. The wind came strong, but from directions that\\nmade the sails useless. With all Captain Domon’s demand for speed, the vessel crept along. By night\\na man in the bows cast a tallowed lead by lantern light, calling back the depth to the steersman, while\\nthe current carried her downriver against the wind with the sweeps pulled in. There were no rocks to\\nfear in the Arinelle, but shallows and shoals there were aplenty, where a boat could go hard aground\\nto remain, bows and more dug into the mud, until help came. If it was help that came first. By day the\\nsweeps worked from sunrise to sunset, but the wind fought them as if it wanted to push the boat back\\nupriver.\\nThey did not put in to shore, neither by day nor by night. Bayle Domon drove boat and crew\\nalike hard, railing at the contrary winds, cursing the slow pace.

Each\\ntime the grumblings began, he silently brought out the long, scythe-like sword and cruelly hooked axe\\nthat had been found on the deck after the attack. He would hang them on the mast for an hour, and\\nthose who had been wounded would finger their bandages, and the mutterings quieted for a day or so,\\nat least, until one or another of the crew began thinking once more that surely they had left the\\nTrollocs far behind by now, and the cycle began yet again.\\nRand noticed that Thom Merrilin stayed clear of the crew when they began whispering together\\nand frowning, though usually he was slapping backs and telling jokes and exchanging banter in a way\\nthat put a grin on even the hardest-working man. Thom watched those secretive mutters with a wary\\neye while appearing to be absorbed in lighting his long-stemmed pipe, or tuning his harp, or almost\\nanything except paying any mind at all to the crew. Rand did not understand why. It was not the three\\nwho had come aboard chased by Trollocs whom the crew seemed to blame, but rather Floran Gelb.\\nFor the first day or two Gelb’s wiry figure could almost always be found addressing any\\ncrewman he could corner, telling his version of the night Rand and the others came on board. Gelb’s\\nmanner slid from bluster to whines and back again, and his lip always curled when he pointed to\\nThom or Mat, or especially Rand, trying to lay the blame on them.\\n“They’re strangers,” Gelb pleaded, quietly and with an eye out for the captain. “What do we\\nknow of them? The Trollocs came with them, that’s what we know. They’re in league.”\\n“Fortune, Gelb, stow it,” growled a man with his hair in a pigtail and a small blue star tattooed\\non his cheek. He did not look at Gelb as he coiled a line on deck, working it in with his bare toes. All\\nthe sailors went barefoot despite the cold; boots could slip on a wet deck. “You’d call your mother\\nDarkfriend if it’d let you slack. Get away from me!” He spat on Gelb’s foot and went back to the line.\\nAll the crew remembered the watch Gelb had not kept, and the pigtailed man’s was the politest\\nresponse he got. No one even wanted to work with him. Gelb found himself relegated to solitary\\ntasks, all of them filthy, such as scrubbing the galley’s greasy pots, or crawling into the bilges on his\\nbelly to search for leaks among years of slime. Soon he stopped talking to anyone. His shoulders took\\non a defensive hunch, and injured silence became his stance—the more people watching, the more\\ninjured, though it earned him no more than a grunt. When Gelb’s eyes fell on Rand, however, or on\\nMat or Thom, murder flashed across his long-nosed face.\\nWhen Rand mentioned to Mat that Gelb would cause them trouble sooner or later, Mat looked\\naround the boat, saying, “Can we trust any of them? Any at all?” Then he went off to find a place\\nwhere he could be alone, or as alone as he could get on a boat less than thirty paces from its raised\\nbow to the sternpost where the steering oars were mounted. Mat had spent too much time alone since\\nthe night at Shadar Logoth; brooding, as Rand saw it.\\nThom said, “Trouble won’t come from Gelb, boy, if it comes. Not yet, at least. None of the crew\\nwill back him, and he hasn’t the nerve to try anything alone. But the others, now . . . ? Domon almost\\nseems to think the Trollocs are chasing him, personally, but the rest are beginning to think the danger\\nis past. They might just decide they have had enough. They’re on the edge of it, as it is.” He hitched\\nhis patch-covered cloak, and Rand had the feeling he was checking his hidden knives—his second-\\nbest set. “If they mutiny, boy, they won’t leave passengers behind to tell the tale. The Queen’s Writ\\nmight not have much force this far from Caemlyn, but even a village mayor will do something about\\nthat.” That was when Rand, too, began trying not to be noticed when he watched the crewmen.\\nThom did his part in diverting the crew from thoughts of mutiny.

To\\nsupport the notion that Rand and Mat wanted to be apprentice gleemen, he set aside a time each day\\nfor lessons, and that was an entertainment for the crew, as well. He would not let either of them touch\\nhis harp, of course, and their sessions with the flute produced pained winces, in the beginning, at\\nleast, and laughter from the crew even while they were covering their ears.\\nHe taught the boys some of the easier stories, a little simple tumbling, and, of course, juggling.\\nMat complained about what Thom demanded of them, but Thom blew out his mustaches and glared\\nright back.\\n“I don’t know how to play at teaching, boy. I either teach a thing, or I don’t. Now! Even a\\ncountry bumpkin ought to be able to do a simple handstand. Up you go.”\\nCrewmen who were not working always gathered, squatting in a circle around the three. Some\\neven tried their hand at the lessons Thom taught, laughing at their own fumblings. Gelb stood alone\\nand watched it all darkly, hating them all.\\nA good part of each day Rand spent leaning on the railing, staring at the shore. It was not that he\\nreally expected to see Egwene or any of the others suddenly appear on the riverbank, but the boat\\ntraveled so slowly that he sometimes hoped for it. They could catch up without riding too hard. If they\\nhad escaped. If they were still alive.\\nThe river rolled on without any sign of life, nor any boat to be seen except the \\nSpray\\n. But that\\nwas not to say there was nothing to see, and wonder at. In the middle of the first day, the Arinelle ran\\nbetween high bluffs that stretched for half a mile on either side. For that whole length the stone had\\nbeen cut into figures, men and women a hundred feet tall, with crowns proclaiming them kings and\\nqueens. No two were alike in that royal procession, and long years separated the first from the last.\\nWind and rain had worn those at the north end smooth and almost featureless, with faces and details\\nbecoming more distinct as they went south. The river lapped around the statues’ feet, feet washed to\\nsmooth nubs, those that were not gone completely. \\nHow long have they stood there\\n, Rand wondered.\\nHow long for the river to wear away so much stone?\\n None of the crew so much as looked up from\\ntheir work, they had seen the ancient carvings so many times before.\\nAnother time, when the eastward shore had become flat grassland again, broken only\\noccasionally by thickets; the sun glinted off something in the distance. “What can that be?” Rand\\nwondered aloud. “It looks like metal.”\\nCaptain Domon was walking by, and he paused, squinting toward the glint. “It do be metal,” he\\nsaid. His words still ran together, but Rand had come to understand without having to puzzle it out.\\n“A tower of metal. I have seen it close up, and I know. River traders use it as a marker. We be ten\\ndays from Whitebridge at the rate we go.”\\n“A metal tower?” Rand said, and Mat, sitting cross-legged with his back against a barrel, roused\\nfrom his brooding to listen.\\nThe captain nodded. “Aye. Shining steel, by the look and feel of it, but no a spot of rust. Two\\nhundred feet high, it be, as big around as a house, with no a mark on it and never an opening to be\\nfound.”\\n“I’ll bet there’s treasure inside,” Mat said. He stood up and stared toward the far tower as the\\nriver carried the \\nSpray\\n beyond it. “A thing like that must have been made to protect something\\nvaluable.”\\n“Mayhap, lad,” the captain rumbled. “There be stranger things in the world than this, though.

Tremalking?” A clump of trees slid in front of the\\nshining tower, but he stared as if he could see it yet.\\nCaptain Domon shook his head. “No, lad, it no be the treasure that makes for seeing the world. If\\nyou find yourself a fistful of gold, or some dead king’s jewels, all well and good, but it be the\\nstrangeness you see that pulls you to the next horizon. In Tanchico—that be a port on the Aryth Ocean\\n—part of the Panarch’s Palace were built in the Age of Legends, so it be said. There be a wall there\\nwith a frieze showing animals no man living has ever seen.”\\n“Any child can draw an animal nobody’s ever seen,” Rand said, and the captain chuckled.\\n“Aye, lad, so they can. But can a child make the bones of those animals? In Tanchico they have\\nthem, all fastened together like the animal was. They stand in a part of the Panarch’s Palace where\\nany can enter and see. The Breaking left a thousand wonders behind, and there been half a dozen\\nempires or more since, some rivaling Artur Hawkwing’s, every one leaving things to see and find.\\nLightsticks and razorlace and heartstone. A crystal lattice covering an island, and it hums when the\\nmoon is up. A mountain hollowed into a bowl, and in its center, a silver spike a hundred spans high,\\nand any who comes within a mile of it, dies. Rusted ruins, and broken bits, and things found on the\\nbottom of the sea, things not even the oldest books know the meaning of I’ve gathered a few, myself.\\nThings you never dreamed of, in more places than you can see in ten lifetimes. That be the strangeness\\nthat will draw you on.”\\n“We used to dig up bones in the Sand Hills,” Rand said slowly. “Strange bones. There was part\\nof a fish—I think it was a fish—as big as this boat, once. Some said it was bad luck, digging in the\\nhills.”\\nThe captain eyed him shrewdly. “You thinking about home already, lad, and you just set out in\\nthe world? The world will put a hook in your mouth. You’ll set off chasing the sunset, you wait and\\nsee . . . and if you ever go back, your village’ll no be big enough to hold you.”\\n“No!” He gave a start. How long had it been since he had thought of home, of Emond’s Field?\\nAnd what of Tam? It had to be days. It felt like months. “I will go home, one day, when I can. I’ll\\nraise sheep, like . . . like my father, and if I never leave again it will be too soon. Isn’t that right, Mat?\\nAs soon as we can we’re going home and forget all this even exists.”\\nWith a visible effort Mat pulled away from staring upriver after the vanished tower. “What? Oh.\\nYes, of course. We’ll go home. Of course.” As he turned to go, Rand heard him muttering under his\\nbreath. “I’ll bet he just doesn’t want anybody else going after the treasure.” He did not seem to realize\\nhe had spoken aloud.\\nFour days into their trip downriver found Rand atop the mast, sitting on the blunt end with his\\nlegs wrapped in the stays. The \\nSpray\\n rolled gently on the river, but fifty feet above the water that easy\\nroll made the top of the mast sway back and forth through wide arcs. He threw back his head and\\nlaughed into the wind that blew in his face.\\nThe oars were out, and from here the boat looked like some twelve-legged spider creeping\\ndown the Arinelle. He had been as high as this before, in trees back in the Two Rivers, but this time\\nthere were no branches to block his view. Everything on deck, the sailors at the sweeps, men on their\\nknees scrubbing the deck with smoothstones, men doing things with lines and hatchcovers, looked so\\nodd when seen from right overhead, all squat and foreshortened, that he had spent an hour just staring\\nat them and chuckling.\\nHe still chuckled whenever he looked down at them, but now he was staring at the riverbanks'),\n",

That was the way it seemed, as if he were still—except for the swaying back and forth, of\\ncourse—and the banks slid slowly by, trees and hills marching along to either side. He was still, and\\nthe whole world moved past him.\\nOn sudden impulse he unwrapped his legs from the stays bracing the mast and held his arms and\\nlegs out to either side, balancing against the sway. For three complete arcs he kept his balance like\\nthat, then suddenly it was gone. Arms and legs windmilling, he toppled forward and grabbed the\\nforestay. Legs splayed to either side of the mast, nothing holding him to his precarious perch but his\\ntwo hands on the stay, he laughed. Gulping huge breaths of the fresh, cold wind, he laughed with the\\nexhilaration of it.\\n“Lad,” came Thom’s hoarse voice. “Lad, if you’re trying to break your fool neck, don’t do it by\\nfalling on me.”\\nRand looked down. Thom clung to the ratlines just below him, staring up the last few feet grimly.\\nLike Rand, the gleeman had left his cloak below. “Thom,” he said delightedly. “Thom, when did you\\ncome up here?”\\n“When you wouldn’t pay any attention to people shouting at you. Burn me, boy, you’ve got\\neverybody thinking you’ve gone mad.”\\nHe looked down and was surprised to see all the faces staring up at him. Only Mat, sitting cross-\\nlegged up in the bows with his back to the mast, was not looking at him. Even the men at the oars had\\ntheir eyes raised, letting their stroke go ragged. And no one was berating them for it. Rand twisted his\\nhead around to look under his arm at the stern. Captain Domon stood by the steering oar, ham-like\\nfists on his hips, glaring at him atop the mast. He turned back to grin at Thom. “You want me to come\\ndown, then?”\\nThom nodded vigorously. “I would appreciate it greatly.”\\n“All right.” Shifting his grip on the forestay, he sprang forward off the mast top. He heard Thom\\nbite off an oath as his fall was cut short and he dangled from the forestay by his hands. The gleeman\\nscowled at him, one hand half stretched out to catch him. He grinned at Thom again. “I’m going down\\nnow.”\\nSwinging his legs up, he hooked one knee over the thick line that ran from the mast to the bow,\\nthen caught it in the crook of his elbow and let go with his hands. Slowly, then with increasing speed,\\nhe slid down. Just short of the bow he dropped to his feet on the deck right in front of Mat, took one\\nstep to catch his balance, and turned to face the boat with arms spread wide, the way Thom did after a\\ntumbling trick.\\nScattered clapping rose from the crew, but he was looking down at Mat in surprise, and at what\\nMat held, hidden from everyone else by his body. A curved dagger with a gold scabbard worked in\\nstrange symbols. Fine gold wire wrapped the hilt, which was capped by a ruby as big as Rand’s\\nthumbnail, and the quillons were golden-scaled serpents baring their fangs.\\nMat continued to slide the dagger in and out of its sheath for a moment. Still playing with the\\ndagger he raised his head slowly; his eyes had a faraway look. Suddenly they focused on Rand, and\\nhe gave a start and stuffed the dagger under his coat.\\nRand squatted on his heels, with his arms crossed on his knees. “Where did you get that?” Mat\\nsaid nothing, looking quickly to see if anyone else was close by. They were alone, for a wonder.\\n“You didn’t take it from Shadar Logoth, did you?”\\nMat stared at him. “It’s your fault. Yours and Perrin’s. The two of you pulled me away from the\\ntreasure, and I had it in my hand. Mordeth didn’t give it to me. I took it, so Moiraine’s warnings about\\nhis gifts don’t count.

This is the first chance I’ve had to ask without six people listening.”\\nMat turned his head away, giving him a sidelong look. “Maybe.”\\n“What do you mean, maybe?

Egwene, on the mare’s back, was just as bad. She\\nwatched the wolves constantly from the corner of her eye, and sometimes she twisted in the saddle to\\nlook around. Perrin was sure she was hunting for the rest of the pack, though she denied it angrily\\nwhen he suggested as much, denied being afraid of the wolves that paced them, denied worrying\\nabout the rest of the pack or what it was up to. She denied, and went right on looking, tight-eyed and\\nwetting her lips uneasily.\\nThe rest of the pack was far distant; he could have told her that. \\nWhat good, even if she believed\\nme? Especially if she did\\n. He was of no mind to open that basket of snakes until he had to. He did not\\nwant to think about \\nhow\\n he knew. The fur-clad man loped ahead of them, sometimes looking almost\\nlike a wolf himself, and he never looked around when Dapple, Hopper, and Wind appeared, but he\\nknew, too.\\nThe Emond’s Fielders had wakened at dawn that first morning to find Elyas cooking more rabbit\\nand watching them over his full beard without much expression. Except for Dapple, Hopper, and\\nWind, no wolves were to be seen. In the pale, early daylight, deep shade still lingered under the big\\noak, and the bare trees beyond looked like fingers stripped to the bone.\\n“They’re around,” Elyas answered when Egwene asked where the rest of the pack had gone.\\n“Close enough to help, if need be. Far enough off to avoid any human trouble we get into. Sooner or\\nlater there’s always trouble when there’s two humans together. If we need them, they’ll be there.”\\nSomething tickled the back of Perrin’s mind as he ripped free a bite of roast rabbit. A direction,\\nvaguely sensed. \\nOf course! That’s where they\\n. . . . The hot juices in his mouth abruptly lost all taste.\\nHe picked at the tubers Elyas had cooked in the coals—they tasted something like turnips—but his\\nappetite was gone.\\nWhen they had started out Egwene insisted that everyone take a turn riding, and Perrin did not\\neven bother to argue.\\n“First turn is yours,” he told her.\\nShe nodded. “And then you, Elyas.”\\n“My own legs are good enough for me,” Elyas said. He looked at Bela, and the mare rolled her\\neyes as if he were one of the wolves. “Besides, I don’t think she wants me riding her.”\\n“That’s nonsense,” Egwene replied firmly. “There is no point in being stubborn about it. The\\nsensible thing is for everybody to ride sometimes. According to you we have a long way still to go.”\\n“I said no, girl.”\\nShe took a deep breath, and Perrin was wondering if she would succeed in bullying Elyas the'),\n",

Egwene stepped back from the\\nraw-boned man, and licked her lips, and stepped back again. Before Elyas turned away, she had\\nbacked all the way to Bela and scrambled up onto the mare’s back. As the man turned to lead them\\nsouth, Perrin thought his grin was a good deal like a wolf’s, too.\\nFor three days they traveled in that manner, walking and riding south and east all day, stopping\\nonly when twilight thickened. Elyas seemed to scorn the haste of city men, but he did not believe in\\nwasting time when there was somewhere to go.\\nThe three wolves were seldom seen. Each night they came to the fire for a time, and sometimes\\nin the day they showed themselves briefly, appearing close at hand when least expected and vanishing\\nin the same manner. Perrin knew they were out there, though, and where. He knew when they were\\nscouting the path ahead and when they were watching the backtrail. He knew when they left the pack’s\\nusual hunting grounds, and Dapple sent the pack back to wait for her. Sometimes the three that\\nremained faded from his mind, but long before they were close enough to see again, he was aware of\\nthem returning. Even when the trees dwindled to wide-scattered groves separated by great swathes of\\nwinter-dead grass, they were as ghosts when they did not want to be seen, but he could have pointed a\\nfinger straight at them at any time. He did not know how he knew, and he tried to convince himself\\nthat it was just his imagination playing tricks, but it did no good. Just as Elyas knew, he knew.\\nHe tried not thinking about wolves, but they crept into his thoughts all the same. He had not\\ndreamed about Ba’alzamon since meeting Elyas and the wolves. His dreams, as much as he\\nremembered of them on waking, were of everyday things, just as he might have dreamed at home . . .\\nbefore Baerlon . . . before Winternight. Normal dreams—with one addition. In every dream he\\nremembered there was a point where he straightened from Master Luhhan’s forge to wipe the sweat\\nfrom his face, or turned from dancing with the village girls on the Green, or lifted his head from a\\nbook in front of the fireplace, and whether he was outside or under a roof, there was a wolf close to\\nhand. Always the wolf’s back was to him, and always he knew—in the dreams it seemed the normal\\ncourse of things, even at Alsbet Luhhan’s dinner table—that the wolf’s yellow eyes were watching\\nfor what might come, guarding against what might come. Only when he was awake did the dreams\\nseem strange.\\nThree days they journeyed, with Dapple, Hopper, and Wind bringing them rabbits and squirrels,\\nand Elyas pointing out plants, few of which Perrin recognized, as good to eat. Once a rabbit burst out\\nalmost from under Bela’s hooves; before Perrin could get a stone in his sling, Elyas skewered it with\\nhis long knife at twenty paces. Another time Elyas brought down a fat pheasant, on the wing, with his\\nbow. They ate far better than they had when on their own, but Perrin would as soon have gone back\\non short rations if it had meant different company. He was not sure how Egwene felt, but he would\\nhave been willing to go hungry if he could do it without the wolves. Three days, into the afternoon.\\nA stand of trees lay ahead, larger than most they had seen, a good four miles across. The sun sat\\nlow in the western sky, pushing slanted shadows off to their right, and the wind was picking up.\\nPerrin felt the wolves give over quartering behind them and start forward, not hurrying. They had\\nsmelled and seen nothing dangerous. Egwene was taking her turn on Bela. It was time to start looking\\nfor a camp for the night, and the big copse would serve the purpose well.\\nAs they came close to the trees, three mastiffs burst from cover, broadmuzzled dogs as tall as the\\nwolves and even heavier, teeth bared in loud, rumbling snarls. They stopped short as soon as they\\nwere in the open, but no more than thirty feet separated them from the three people, and their dark\\neyes kindled with a killing light.'),\n",

No need to use the axe on dogs; a stone in the ribs\\nwould send the worst dog running.\\nElyas waved a hand at him without taking his eyes from the stiff-legged dogs. “Hssst! None of\\nthat now!”\\nPerrin gave him a puzzled frown, but let the sling slow its spin and finally fall to his side.\\nEgwene managed to get Bela under control; she and the mare both watched the dogs warily.\\nThe mastiffs’ hackles stood stiff, and their ears were laid back, and their growls sounded like\\nearthquakes. Abruptly Elyas raised one finger shoulder high and whistled, a long, shrill whistle that\\nrose higher and higher and did not end. The growls cut off raggedly. The dogs stepped back, whining\\nand turning their heads as if they wanted to go but were held. Their eyes remained locked to Elyas’s\\nfinger.\\nSlowly Elyas lowered his hand, and the pitch of his whistle lowered with it. The dogs followed,\\nuntil they lay flat on the ground, tongues lolling from their mouths. Three tails wagged.\\n“See,” Elyas said, walking to the dogs. “There’s no need for weapons.” The mastiffs licked his\\nhands, and he scratched their broad heads and fondled their ears. “They look meaner than they are.\\nThey meant to frighten us off, and they wouldn’t have bitten unless we tried to go into the trees.\\nAnyway, there’s no worry of that, now. We can make the next thicket before full dark.”\\nWhen Perrin looked at Egwene, her mouth was hanging open. He shut his own mouth with a click\\nof teeth.\\nStill patting the dogs, Elyas studied the stand of trees. “There’ll be Tuatha’an here. The\\nTraveling People.” They stared at him blankly, and he added, “Tinkers.”\\n“Tinkers?” Perrin exclaimed. “I’ve always wanted to see the Tinkers. They camp across the\\nriver from Taren Ferry sometimes, but they don’t come down into the Two Rivers, as far as I know. I\\ndon’t know why not.”\\nEgwene sniffed. “Probably because the Taren Ferry folk are as great thieves as the Tinkers.\\nThey’d no doubt end up stealing each other blind. Master Elyas, if there really are Tinkers close by,\\nshouldn’t we go on? We don’t want Bela stolen, and . . . well, we do not have much else, but\\neverybody knows Tinkers will steal anything.”\\n“Including infants?” Elyas asked dryly. “Kidnap children, and all that?” He spat, and she\\nblushed. Those stories about babies were told sometimes, but most often by Cenn Buie or one of the\\nCoplins or Congars. The other tales, everybody knew. “The Tinkers make me sick sometimes, but\\nthey don’t steal any more than most folks. A good bit less than some I know.”\\n“It will be getting dark soon, Elyas,” Perrin said. “We have to camp somewhere. Why not with\\nthem, if they’ll have us?” Mistress Luhhan had a Tinker-mended pot that she claimed was better than\\nnew. Master Luhhan was not too happy about his wife’s praise of the Tinker work, but Perrin wanted\\nto see how it was done. Yet there was a reluctance about Elyas that he did not understand. “Is there\\nsome reason we shouldn’t?”\\nElyas shook his head, but the reluctance was still there, in the set of his shoulders and the\\ntightness of his mouth. “May as well. Just don’t pay any mind to what they say. Lot of foolishness.\\nMost times the Traveling People do things any which way, but there’s times they set a store by\\nformality, so you do what I do. And keep your secrets. No need to tell the world everything.”\\nThe dogs trailed along beside them, wagging their tails, as Elyas led the way into the trees.\\nPerrin felt the wolves slow, and knew they would not enter. They were not afraid of the dogs—they\\nwere contemptuous of dogs, who had given up freedom to sleep by a fire—but people they avoided.'),\n",

Their wagons were small houses on\\nwheels, tall wooden boxes lacquered and painted in bright colors, reds and blues and yellows and\\ngreens and some hues to which he could not put a name. The Traveling People were going about work\\nthat was disappointingly everyday, cooking, sewing, tending children, mending harness, but their\\nclothes were even more colorful than the wagons—and seemingly chosen at random; sometimes coat\\nand breeches, or dress and shawl, went together in a way that hurt his eyes. They looked like\\nbutterflies in a field of wildflowers.\\nFour or five men in different places around the camp played fiddles and flutes, and a few people\\ndanced like rainbow-hued hummingbirds. Children and dogs ran playing among the cookfires. The\\ndogs were mastiffs just like those that had confronted the travelers, but the children tugged at their\\nears and tails and climbed on their backs, and the massive dogs accepted it all placidly.

Even the children and dogs stood still and watched, warily, as if on the point of flight.\\nFor a moment there was no sound at all, then a wiry man, gray-haired and short, stepped forward\\nand bowed gravely to Elyas. He wore a high-collared red coat, and baggy, bright green trousers\\ntucked into knee boots. “You are welcome to our fires. Do you know the song?”\\nElyas bowed in the same way, both hands pressed to his chest. “Your welcome warms my spirit,\\nMahdi, as your fires warm the flesh, but I do not know the song.”\\n“Then we seek still,” the gray-haired man intoned. “As it was, so shall it be, if we but\\nremember, seek, and find.” He swept an arm toward the fires with a smile, and his voice took on a\\ncheerful lightness. “The meal is almost ready. Join us, please.”\\nAs if that had been a signal the music sprang up again, and the children took up their laughter and\\nran with the dogs. Everyone in the camp went back to what they had been doing just as though the\\nnewcomers were long-accepted friends.\\nThe gray-haired man hesitated, though, and looked at Elyas. “Your . . . other friends? They will\\nstay away? They frighten the poor dogs so.”\\n“They’ll stay away, Raen.” Elyas’s headshake had a touch of scorn. “You should know that by\\nnow.”\\nThe gray-haired man spread his hands as if to say nothing was ever certain. As he turned to lead\\nthem into the camp, Egwene dismounted and moved close to Elyas. “You two are friends?” A smiling\\nTinker appeared to take Bela; Egwene gave the reins up reluctantly, after a wry snort from Elyas.\\n“We know each other,” the fur-clad man replied curtly.\\n“His name is Mahdi?” Perrin said.\\nElyas growled something under his breath. “His name’s Raen. Mahdi’s his title. Seeker. He’s the\\nleader of this band. You can call him Seeker if the other sounds odd. He won’t mind.”\\n“What was that about a song?” Egwene asked.\\n“That’s why they travel,” Elyas said, “or so they say. They’re looking for a song. That’s what the\\nMahdi seeks. They say they lost it during the Breaking of the World, and if they can find it again, the\\nparadise of the Age of Legends will return.” He ran his eye around the camp and snorted. “They don’t'),\n",

The Seeker’s wagon was yellow\\ntrimmed in red, and the spokes of its tall, red-rimmed wheels alternated red and yellow. A plump\\nwoman, as gray as Raen but smooth-cheeked still, came out of the wagon and paused on the steps at\\nits back end, straightening a blue-fringed shawl on her shoulders. Her blouse was yellow and her\\nskirt red, both bright. The combination made Perrin blink, and Egwene made a strangled sound.\\nWhen she saw the people following Raen, the woman came down with a welcoming smile. She\\nwas Ila, Raen’s wife, a head taller than her husband, and she soon made Perrin forget about the colors\\nof her clothes. She had a motherliness that reminded him of Mistress al’Vere and had him feeling\\nwelcome from her first smile.\\nIla greeted Elyas as an old acquaintance, but with a distance that seemed to pain Raen. Elyas\\ngave her a dry grin and a nod. Perrin and Egwene introduced themselves, and she clasped their hands\\nin both of hers with much more warmth than she had shown Elyas, even hugging Egwene.\\n“Why, you’re lovely, child,” she said, cupping Egwene’s chin and smiling. “And chilled to the\\nbone, too, I expect. You sit close to the fire, Egwene. All of you sit. Supper is almost ready.”\\nFallen logs had been pulled around the fire for sitting. Elyas refused even that concession to\\ncivilization. He lounged on the ground, instead. Iron tripods held two small kettles over the flames,\\nand an oven rested in the edge of the coals. Ila tended them.\\nAs Perrin and the others were taking their places, a slender young man wearing green stripes\\nstrolled up to the fire. He gave Raen a hug and Ila a kiss, and ran a cool eye over Elyas and the\\nEmond’s Fielders. He was about the same age as Perrin, and he moved as if he were about to begin\\ndancing with his next step.\\n“Well, Aram”—Ila smiled fondly—“you have decided to eat with your old grandparents for a\\nchange, have you?” Her smile slid over to Egwene as she bent to stir a kettle hanging over the\\ncookfire. “I wonder why?”\\nAram settled to an easy crouch with his arms crossed on his knees, across the fire from Egwene.\\n“I am Aram,” he told her in a low, confident voice. He no longer seemed aware that anyone was there\\nexcept her. “I have waited for the first rose of spring, and now I find it at my grandfather’s fire.”\\nPerrin waited for Egwene to snicker, then saw that she was staring back at Aram. He looked at\\nthe young Tinker again. Aram had more than his share of good looks, he admitted. After a minute\\nPerrin knew who the fellow reminded him of. Wil al’Seen, who had all the girls staring and\\nwhispering behind his back whenever he came up from Deven Ride to Emond’s Field.

Aram gave him an irritated glance, but it was Raen who\\nanswered.\\n“It means that no man should harm another for any reason whatsoever.” The Seeker’s eyes\\nflickered to Elyas. “There is no excuse for violence. None. Not ever.”\\n“What if somebody attacks you?” Perrin insisted. “What if somebody hits you, or tries to rob\\nyou, or kill you?”\\nRaen sighed, a patient sigh, as if Perrin was just not seeing what was so clear to him. “If a man\\nhit me, I would ask him why he wanted to do such a thing. If he still wanted to hit me, I would run\\naway, as I would if he wanted to rob or kill me. Much better that I let him take what he wanted, even\\nmy life, than that I should do violence. And I would hope that he was not harmed too greatly.”\\n“But you said you wouldn’t hurt him,” Perrin said. “I would not, but violence harms the one who\\ndoes it as much as the one who receives it.” Perrin looked doubtful. “You could cut down a tree with\\nyour axe,” Raen said. “The axe does violence to the tree, and escapes unharmed. Is that how you see\\nit? Wood is soft compared to steel, but the sharp steel is dulled as it chops, and the sap of the tree\\nwill rust and pit it. The mighty axe does violence to the helpless tree, and is harmed by it. So it is\\nwith men, though the harm is in the spirit.”\\n“But—”\\n“Enough,” Elyas growled, cutting Perrin off. “Raen, it’s bad enough you trying to convert village\\nyounglings to that nonsense—it gets you in trouble almost everywhere you go, doesn’t it?—but I\\ndidn’t bring this lot here for you to work on them. Leave over.”\\n“And leave them to you?” Ila said, grinding herbs between her palms and letting them trickle into\\none of the kettles. Her voice was calm, but her hands rubbed the herbs furiously. “Will you teach them\\nyour way, to kill or die? Will you lead them to the fate you seek for yourself, dying alone with only\\nthe ravens and your . . . your friends to squabble over your body?”\\n“Be at peace, Ila,” Raen said gently, as if he had heard this all and more a hundred times. “He\\nhas been welcomed to our fire, my wife.”\\nIla subsided, but Perrin noticed that she made no apology. Instead she looked at Elyas and shook\\nher head sadly, then dusted her hands and began taking spoons and pottery bowls from a red chest on\\nthe side of the wagon.\\nRaen turned back to Elyas. “My old friend, how many times must I tell you that we do not try to\\nconvert anyone. When village people are curious about our ways, we answer their questions. It is\\nmost often the young who ask, true, and sometimes one of them will come with us when we journey\\non, but it is of their own free will.”\\n“You try telling that to some farm wife who’s just found out her son or daughter has run off with\\nyou Tinkers,” Elyas said wryly. “That’s why the bigger towns won’t even let you camp nearby.\\nVillages put up with you for your mending things, but the cities don’t need it, and they don’t like you\\ntalking their young folks into running off.”\\n“I would not know what the cities allow.” Raen’s patience seemed inexhaustible. He certainly\\ndid not appear to be getting angry at all. “There are always violent men in cities. In any case, I do not\\nthink the song could be found in a city.”\\n“I don’t mean to offend you, Seeker,” Perrin said slowly, “but. . . . Well, I don’t look for\\nviolence.

The Lost go to live in\\nthe villages.”\\nIla stared in the direction her grandson had gone. “The Lost cannot be happy.” She sighed, but\\nher face was placid again when she handed out the bowls and spoons.\\nPerrin stared at the ground, wishing he had not asked, and there was no more talk while Ila filled\\ntheir bowls with a thick vegetable stew and handed out thick slices of her crusty bread, nor while they\\nate. The stew was delicious, and Perrin finished three bowls before he stopped.

The\\ncamp had settled in for the night, but the bustle did not slow, only changed. The musicians who had\\nbeen playing when they entered the camp had been replaced by others, and even more people than\\nbefore danced in the light of the fires, their shadows leaping against the wagons.

The Aiel Waste? They were crossing the Aiel Waste?”\\n“Some people can enter the Waste without being bothered,” Elyas said. “Gleemen. Peddlers, if\\nthey’re honest. The Tuatha’an cross the Waste all the time.

Sometimes I\\nworry that they might know the song, though I suppose it isn’t likely. Among Aiel, men do not sing,\\nyou know. Isn’t that strange? From the time an Aiel boy becomes a man he will not sing anything but\\nbattle chants, or their dirge for the slain. I have heard them singing over their dead, and over those\\nthey have killed. That song is one to make the stones weep.” Ila, listening, nodded agreement over her\\nknitting.\\nPerrin did some quick rethinking. He had thought the Tinkers must be afraid all the time, with all\\nthis talk of running away, but no one who was afraid would even think of crossing the Aiel Waste.\\nFrom what he had heard, no one who was sane would try crossing the Waste.\\n“If this is some story about a song,” Elyas began, but Raen shook his head.\\n“No, my old friend, not a song. I am not sure I know what it is about.” He turned his attention to\\nPerrin. “Young Aiel often travel into the Blight. Some of the young men go alone, thinking for some\\nreason that they have been called to kill the Dark One. Most go in small groups. To hunt Trollocs.”\\nRaen shook his head sadly, and when he went on his voice was heavy. “Two years ago a band of the\\nPeople crossing the Waste about a hundred miles south of the Blight found one of these groups.”\\n“Young women,” Ila put in, as sorrowful as her husband. “Little more than girls.”\\nPerrin made a surprised sound, and Elyas grinned at him wryly.\\n“Aiel girls don’t have to tend house and cook if they don’t want to, boy. The ones who want to\\nbe warriors, instead, join one of the warrior societies, \\nFar Dareis Mai\\n, the Maidens of the Spear,\\nand fight right alongside the men.”\\nPerrin shook his head. Elyas chuckled at his expression.\\nRaen took up the story again, distaste and perplexity mingled in his voice. “The young women\\nwere all dead except one, and she was dying. She crawled to the wagons. It was clear she knew they\\nwere Tuatha’an. Her loathing outweighed her pain, but she had a message so important to her that she\\nmust pass it on to someone, even us, before she died. Men went to see if they could help any of the\\nothers—there was a trail of her blood to follow—but all were dead, and so were three times their\\nnumber in Trollocs.”\\nElyas sat up, his pipe almost falling from between his teeth. “A hundred miles into the Waste?\\nImpossible! \\nDjevik K’Shar\\n, that’s what Trollocs call the Waste. The Dying Ground.

The\\nTrollocs had followed, but by the tracks only a few lived to return after killing the Aiel. As for the\\ngirl, she would not let anyone touch her, even to tend her wounds.

Deftly, Thom snagged the instrument from Mat’s fist\\nand fitted it into its hard leather case. “I thought all you shepherds whiled away the time with the\\nflock playing the pipes or the flute. That will show me to trust what I don’t know firsthand.”\\n“Rand’s the shepherd,” Mat grumbled. “He plays the pipes, not me.”\\n“Yes, well, he does have a little aptitude. Perhaps we had better work on juggling, boy. At least\\nyou show some talent for that.”\\n“Thom,” Rand said, “I don’t know why you’re trying so hard.” He glanced at the sailor and\\nlowered his voice. “After all, we aren’t really trying to become gleemen.

There’s nothing to say they’re even\\nstill alive.”\\n“They’re alive,” Rand said firmly. He turned to Mat for support, but Mat’s eyebrows were\\npinched down on his nose, and his mouth was a thin line, and his eyes were fixed on the deck. “Well,\\nspeak up,” Rand told him. “You can’t be that mad over not being able to play the flute.

It looked all of one piece, as if it had been carved from a single\\nstone or molded by a giant’s hand, broad and tall, leaping the river with an airy grace that almost\\nmade the eye forget its size. All in all it dwarfed the town that sprawled about its foot on the east\\nbank, though Whitebridge was larger by far than Emond’s Field, with houses of stone and brick as tall\\nas those in Taren Ferry and wooden docks like thin fingers sticking out into the river.

I sail with the first light on the morrow.” He\\nturned on his heel and strode back to the merchants, arms spreading wide as he began an apology for\\nkeeping them waiting.\\nThom still hesitated, but Rand hustled him down the gangplank without giving him a chance to\\nargue, and the gleeman let himself be herded. A murmur passed through the people on the dock as they\\nsaw Thom’s patch-covered cloak, and some called out to discover where he would be performing. \\nSo\\nmuch for not being noticed\\n, Rand thought, dismayed. By sundown it would be all over Whitebridge\\nthat there was a gleeman in town. He hurried Thom along, though, and Thom, wrapped in sulky\\nsilence, did not even try to slow down enough to preen under the attention.\\nThe carriage drivers looked down at Thom with interest from their high perches, but apparently\\nthe dignity of their positions forbade shouting. With no idea of where to go exactly, Rand turned up\\nthe street that ran along the river and under the bridge.\\n“We need to find Moiraine and the others,” he said. “And fast. We should have thought of\\nchanging Thom’s cloak.”\\nThom suddenly shook himself and stopped dead. “An innkeeper will be able to tell us if they’re\\nhere, or if they’ve passed through. The right innkeeper. Innkeepers have all the news and gossip. If\\nthey aren’t here. . . .”He looked back and forth from Rand to Mat. “We have to talk, we three.” Cloak\\nswirling around his ankles, he set off into the town, away from the river. Rand and Mat had to step\\nquickly to keep up.\\nThe broad, milk-white arch that gave the town its name dominated Whitebridge as much close up\\nas it did from afar, but once Rand was in the streets he realized that the town was every bit as big as\\nBaerlon, though not so crowded with people. A few carts moved in the streets, pulled by horse or ox\\nor donkey or man, but no carriages. Those most likely all belonged to the merchants and were\\nclustered down at the dock.\\nShops of every description lined the streets, and many of the tradesmen worked in front of their\\nestablishments, under the signs swinging in the wind. They passed a man mending pots, and a tailor\\nholding folds of cloth up to the light for a customer. A shoemaker, sitting in his doorway, tapped his'),\n",

Hawkers cried their services at sharpening knives and scissors, or tried\\nto interest the passersby in their skimpy trays of fruit or vegetables, but none was getting much\\ninterest. Shops selling food had the same pitiful displays of produce Rand remembered from Baerlon.\\nEven the fishmongers displayed only small piles of small fish, for all the boats on the river. Times\\nwere not really hard yet, but everyone could see what was coming if the weather did not change soon,\\nand those faces that were not fixed into worried frowns seemed to stare at something unseen,\\nsomething unpleasant.\\nWhere the White Bridge came down in the center of the town was a big square, paved with\\nstones worn by generations of feet and wagon wheels. Inns surrounded the square, and shops, and tall,\\nred brick houses with signs out front bearing the same names Rand had seen on the carriages at the\\ndock. It was into one of those inns, seemingly chosen at random, that Thom ducked. The sign over the\\ndoor, swinging in the wind, had a striding man with a bundle on his back on one side and the same\\nman with his head on a pillow on the other, and proclaimed The Wayfarers’ Rest.\\nThe common room stood empty except for the fat innkeeper drawing ale from a barrel and two\\nmen in rough workman’s clothes staring glumly into their mugs at a table in the back. Only the\\ninnkeeper looked up when they came in. A shoulder-high wall split the room in two from front to\\nback, with tables and a blazing fireplace on each side. Rand wondered idly if all innkeepers were fat\\nand losing their hair.\\nRubbing his hands together briskly, Thom commented to the innkeeper on the late cold and\\nordered hot spiced wine, then added quietly, “Is there somewhere my friends and I could talk without\\nbeing disturbed?”\\nThe innkeeper nodded to the low wall. “The other side that’s as best I’ve got unless you want to\\ntake a room. For when sailors come up from the river. Seems like half the crews got grudges against\\nthe other half. I won’t have my place broke up by fights, so I keep them apart.” He had been eyeing\\nThom’s cloak the whole while, and now he cocked his head to one side, a sly look in his eyes. “You\\nstaying? Haven’t had a gleeman here in some time. Folks would pay real good for something as\\nwould take their minds off things. I’d even take some off on your room and meals.”\\nUnnoticed\\n, Rand thought glumly.\\n“You are too generous,” Thom said with a smooth bow. “Perhaps I will take up your offer. But\\nfor now, a little privacy.”\\n“I’ll bring your wine. Good money here for a gleeman.”\\nThe tables on the far side of the wall were all empty, but Thom chose one right in the middle of\\nthe space. “So no one can listen without us knowing,” he explained. “Did you hear that fellow? He’ll\\ntake some off. Why, I’d double his custom just by sitting here. Any honest innkeeper gives a gleeman\\nroom and board and a good bit besides.”\\nThe bare table was none too clean, and the floor had not been swept in days if not weeks. Rand\\nlooked around and grimaced. Master al’Vere would not have let his inn get that dirty if he had had to\\nclimb out of a sickbed to see to it. “We’re only after information. Remember?”\\n“Why here?” Mat demanded. “We passed other inns that looked cleaner.”\\n“Straight on from the bridge,” Thom said, “is the road to Caemlyn. Anyone passing through\\nWhitebridge comes through this square, unless they’re going by river, and we know your friends\\naren’t doing that. If there is no word of them here, it doesn’t exist. Let me do the talking. This has to\\nbe done carefully.”\\nJust then the innkeeper appeared, three battered pewter mugs gripped in one fist by the handles.\\nThe fat man flicked at the table with a towel, set the mugs down, and took Thom’s money. “If you'),\n",

Good wine, here.”\\nThom’s smile touched only his mouth. “I will think on it, innkeeper. What news is there? We\\nhave been away from hearing things.”\\n“Big news, that’s what. Big news.”\\nThe innkeeper draped the towel over his shoulder and pulled up a chair. He crossed his arms on\\nthe table, took root with a long sigh, saying what a comfort it was to get off his feet. His name was\\nBartim, and he went on about his feet in detail, about corns and bunions and how much time he spent\\nstanding and what he soaked them in, until Thom mentioned the news, again, and then he shifted over\\nwith hardly a pause.\\nThe news was just as big as he said it was. Logain, the false Dragon, had been captured after a\\nbig battle near Lugard while he was trying to move his army from Ghealdan to Tear. The Prophecies,\\nthey understood? Thom nodded, and Bartim went on. The roads in the south were packed with people,\\nthe lucky ones with what they could carry on their backs. Thousands fleeing in all directions.\\n“None”—Bartim chuckled wryly—“supported Logain, of course. Oh, no, you won’t find many to\\nadmit to that, not now. Just refugees trying to find a safe place during the troubles.”\\nAes Sedai had been involved in taking Logain, of course. Bartim spat on the floor when he said\\nthat, and again when he said they were taking the false Dragon north to Tar Valon. Bartim was a\\ndecent man, he said, a respectable man, and Aes Sedai could all go back to the Blight where they\\ncame from and take Tar Valon with them, as far as he was concerned. He would get no closer to an\\nAes Sedai than a thousand miles, if he had his way. Of course, they were stopping at every village\\nand town on the way north to display Logain, so he had heard. To show people that the false Dragon\\nhad been taken and the world was safe again. He would have liked to see that, even if it did mean\\ngetting close to Aes Sedai. He was halfway tempted to go to Caemlyn.\\n“They’ll be taking him there to show to Queen Morgase.” The innkeeper touched his forehead\\nrespectfully. “I’ve never seen the Queen. Man ought to see his own Queen, don’t you think?”\\nLogain could do “things,” and the way Bartim’s eyes shifted and his tongue darted across his\\nlips made it clear what he meant. He had seen the last false Dragon, two years ago, when he was\\nparaded through the countryside, but that was just some fellow who thought he could make himself a\\nking. There had been no need for Aes Sedai, that time. Soldiers had had him chained up on a wagon.\\nA sullen-looking fellow who moaned in the middle of the wagonbed, covering his head with his arms\\nwhenever people threw stones or poked him with sticks. There had been a lot of that, and the soldiers\\nhad done nothing to stop it, as long as they did not kill the fellow. Best to let the people see he was\\nnothing special after all. He could not do “things.” This Logain would be something to see, though.\\nSomething for Bartim to tell his grandchildren about. If only the inn would let him get away.\\nRand listened with an interest that did not have to be faked. When Padan Fain had brought word\\nto Emond’s Field of a false Dragon, a man actually wielding the Power, it had been the biggest news\\nto come into the Two Rivers in years. What had happened since had pushed it to the back of his mind,\\nbut it was still the sort of thing people would be talking about for years, and telling their\\ngrandchildren about, too. Bartim would probably tell his that he had seen Logain whether he did or\\nnot. Nobody would ever think what happened to some village folk from the Two Rivers was worth\\ntalking about, not unless they were Two Rivers people themselves.\\n“That,” Thom said, “would be something to make a story of, a story they’d tell for a thousand\\nyears. I wish I had been there.” He sounded as if it was the simple truth, and Rand thought it really\\nwas. “I might try to see him anyway. You didn’t say what route they were taking. Perhaps there are\\nsome other travelers around? They might have heard the route.”'),\n",

You\\nwant to see him, go to Caemlyn.

Two days ago there was a fellow in here, an\\nIllianer, with a proclamation all done up with seals and ribbons. Read it right out there in the square.\\nSaid he’s taking it all the way to the Mountains of Mist, maybe even to the Aryth Ocean, if the passes\\nare open.

I hear they’re covered with fog all the year round, and there’s things in the\\nfog will strip the flesh off your bones before you can run.” Mat snickered, earning a sharp look from\\nBartim.\\nThom leaned forward intently. “What did the proclamation say?”\\n“Why, the hunt for the Horn, of course,” Bartim exclaimed. “Didn’t I say that? The Illianers are\\ncalling on everybody as will swear their lives to the hunt to gather in Illian. Can you imagine that?\\nSwearing your life to a legend? I suppose they’ll find some fools. There’s always fools around. This\\nfellow claimed the end of the world is coming. The last battle with the Dark One.” He chuckled, but it\\nhad a hollow sound, a man laughing to convince himself something really was worth laughing at.\\n“Guess they think the Horn of Valere has to be found before it happens. Now what do you think of\\nthat?” He chewed a knuckle pensively for a minute. “Course, I don’t know as I could argue with them\\nafter this winter. The winter, and this fellow Logain, and those other two before, as well. Why all\\nthese fellows the last few years claiming to be the Dragon? And the winter. Must mean something.\\nWhat do you think?”\\nThom did not seem to hear him. In a soft voice the gleeman began to recite to himself.\\n \\n“In the last, lorn fight\\n’gainst the fall of long night,\\nthe mountains stand guard,\\nand the dead shall be ward,\\nfor the grave is no bar to my call.”\\n \\n“That’s it.” Bartim grinned as if he could already see the crowds handing him their money while\\nthey listened to Thom. “That’s it. \\nThe Great Hunt of the Horn\\n. You tell that one, and they’ll be\\nhanging from the rafters in here. Everybody’s heard about the proclamation.”\\nThom still seemed to be a thousand miles away, so Rand said, “We’re looking for some friends\\nwho were coming this way. From the west. Have there been many strangers passing through in the last\\nweek or two?”\\n“Some,” Bartim said slowly. “There’s always some, from east and west both.” He looked at\\neach of them in turn, suddenly wary. “What do they look like, these friends of yours?”\\nRand opened his mouth, but Thom, abruptly back from wherever he had been, gave him a sharp,\\nsilencing look. With an exasperated sigh the gleeman turned to the innkeeper. “Two men and three\\nwomen,” he said reluctantly. “They may be together, or maybe not.” He gave thumbnail sketches,\\npainting each one in just a few words, enough for anyone who had seen them to recognize without\\ngiving away anything about who they were.\\nBartim rubbed one hand over his head, disarranging his thinning hair, and stood up slowly.'),\n",

Crazy, everybody thought. Always talking to himself, never stopped moving even when he\\nwas standing still. Asked about the same people . . . some of them. He asked like it was important,\\nthen acted like he didn’t care what the answer was. Half the time he was saying as he had to wait here\\nfor them, and the other half as he had to go on, he was in a hurry. One minute he was whining and\\nbegging, the next making demands like a king.

If this weaselly\\nfellow was looking for them, he was still nobody they recognized.\\n“Are you sure it was the same people he wanted?” Rand asked.\\n“Some of them. The fighting man, and the woman in silk. But it wasn’t them as he cared about. It\\nwas three country boys.” His eyes slid across Rand and Mat and away again so fast that Rand was not\\nsure if he had really seen the look or imagined it. “He was desperate to find them. But crazy, like I\\nsaid.”\\nRand shivered, and wondered who the crazy man could be, and why he was looking for them. \\nA\\nDarkfriend? Would Ba’alzamon use a madman?\\n“He was crazy, but the other one. . . .” Bartim’s eyes shifted uneasily, and his tongue ran over his\\nlips as if he could not find enough spit to moisten them. “Next day . . . next day the other one came for\\nthe first time.” He fell silent.\\n“The other one?” Thom prompted finally.\\nBartim looked around, although their side of the divided room was still empty except for them.\\nHe even raised up on his toes and looked over the low wall. When he finally spoke, it was in a\\nwhispered rush.\\n“All in black he is. Keeps the hood of his cloak pulled up so you can’t see his face, but you can\\nfeel him looking at you, feel it like an icicle shoved into your spine. He . . . he spoke to me.” He\\nflinched and stopped to chew at his lip before going on. “Sounded like a snake crawling through dead\\nleaves. Fair turned my stomach to ice. Every time as he comes back, he asks the same questions.\\nSame questions the crazy man asked. Nobody ever sees him coming—he’s just there all of a sudden,\\nday or night, freezing you where you stand. People are starting to look over their shoulders. Worst of\\nit is, the gatetenders claim as he’s never passed through any of the gates, coming or going.”\\nRand worked at keeping his face blank; he clenched his jaw until his teeth ached.

Anyway, I’ll tell you what I told him. I haven’t seen any of them, nor heard tell of\\nthem, and that’s the truth. Not any of them,” he finished pointedly. Abruptly he slapped Thom’s money\\ndown on the table. “Just finish your wine and go. All right?

The hunt will center on the road to\\nCaemlyn while we’re on our way to Illian, a thousand miles from where the Myrddraal expect us.”\\n“No,” Rand said firmly. “We wait for Moiraine and the others in Whitebridge, or we go on to\\nCaemlyn. One or the other, Thom. That’s what we decided.”\\n“That’s crazed, boy. Things have changed. You listen to me. No matter what this innkeeper says,\\nwhen a Myrddraal stares at him, he’ll tell all about us down to what we had to drink and how much\\ndust we had on our boots.” Rand shivered, remembering the Fade’s eyeless stare. “As for\\nCaemlyn. . . . You think the Halfmen don’t know you want to get to Tar Valon? It’s a good time to be\\non a boat headed south.”\\n“No, Thom.” Rand had to force the words out, thinking of being a thousand miles from where the\\nFades were looking, but he took a deep breath and managed to firm his voice. “No.”\\n“Think, boy. Illian! There isn’t a grander city on the face of the earth. And the Great Hunt of the\\nHorn! There hasn’t been a Hunt of the Horn in near four hundred years. A whole new cycle of stories\\nwaiting to be made. Just think. You never dreamed of anything like it. By the time the Myrddraal\\nfigure out where you’ve gone to, you’ll be old and gray and so tired of watching your grandchildren\\nyou won’t care if they do find you.”\\nRand’s face took on a stubborn set. “How many times do I have to say no? They’ll find us\\nwherever we go. There’d be Fades waiting in Illian, too. And how do we escape the dreams? I want\\nto know what’s happening to me, Thom, and why. I’m going to Tar Valon. With Moiraine if I can;\\nwithout her if I have to. Alone, if I have to. I need to know.”\\n“But Illian, boy! And a safe way out, downriver while they’re looking for you in another\\ndirection. Blood and ashes, a dream can’t hurt you.”\\nRand kept silent. \\nA dream can’t hurt? Do dream thorns draw real blood?\\n He almost wished he\\nhad told Thom about that dream, too. \\nDo you dare tell anybody? Ba’alzamon is in your dreams, but\\nwhat’s between dreaming and waking, now? Who do you dare to tell that the Dark One is touching\\nyou?\\nThom seemed to understand. The gleeman’s face softened. “Even \\nthose\\n dreams, lad. They are\\nstill just dreams, aren’t they? For the Light’s sake, Mat, talk to him. I know you don’t want to go to\\nTar Valon, at least.”\\nMat’s face reddened, half embarrassment and half anger. He avoided looking at Rand and\\nscowled at Thom instead. “Why are you going to all this fuss and bother? You want to go back to the\\nboat? Go back to the boat. We’ll take care of ourselves.”\\nThe gleeman’s thin shoulders shook with silent laughter, but his voice was anger tight. “You\\nthink you know enough about Myrddraal to escape by yourself, do you? You’re ready to walk into Tar\\nValon alone and hand yourself over to the Amyrlin Seat? Can you even tell one Ajah from another?'),\n",

Rand realized with a shock that he was\\ngripping the dagger from Shadar Logoth, maybe even ready to use it.\\nRaucous laughter broke out on the other side of the low wall dividing the room, and a scornful\\nvoice spoke up loudly.\\n“Trollocs? Put on a gleeman’s cloak, man! You’re drunk! Trollocs! Borderland fables!”\\nThe words doused anger like a pot of cold water. Even Mat half turned to the wall, eyes\\nwidening.\\nRand stood just enough to see over the wall, then ducked back down again with a sinking feeling\\nin his stomach. Floran Gelb sat on the other side of the wall, at the table in the back with the two men\\nwho had been there when they came in. They were laughing at him, but they were listening. Bartim\\nwas wiping a table that badly needed it, not looking at Gelb and the two men, but he was listening,\\ntoo, scrubbing one spot over and over with his towel and leaning toward them until he seemed almost\\nready to fall over.\\n“Gelb,” Rand whispered as he dropped back into his chair, and the others tensed. Thom swiftly\\nstudied their side of the room.\\nOn the other side of the wall the second man’s voice chimed in. “No, no, there used to be\\nTrollocs. But they killed them all in the Trolloc Wars.”\\n“Borderland fables!” the first man repeated.\\n“It’s true, I tell you,” Gelb protested loudly. “I’ve been in the Borderlands. I’ve seen Trollocs,\\nand these were Trollocs as sure as I’m sitting here. Those three claimed the Trollocs were chasing\\nthem, but I know better. That’s why I wouldn’t stay on the \\nSpray.\\n I’ve had my suspicions about Bayle\\nDomon for some time, but those three are Darkfriends for sure. I tell you. . . .” Laughter and coarse\\njokes drowned out the rest of what Gelb had to say.\\nHow long, Rand wondered, before the innkeeper heard a description of “those three”? If he had\\nnot already. If he did not just leap to the three strangers he had already seen. The only door from their\\nhalf of the common room would take them right past Gelb’s table.\\n“Maybe the boat isn’t such a bad idea,” Mat muttered, but Thom shook his head.\\n“Not anymore.” The gleeman spoke softly and fast. He pulled out the leather purse Captain\\nDomon had given him and hastily divided the money into three piles. “That story will be all through\\nthe town in an hour, whether anybody believes it or not, and the Halfman could hear any time. Domon\\nisn’t sailing until tomorrow morning. At best he’ll have Trollocs chasing him all the way to Illian.\\nWell, he’s half expecting it for some reason, but that won’t do us any good. There’s nothing for it but\\nto run, and run hard.”\\nMat quickly stuffed the coins Thom shoved in front of him into his pocket. Rand picked his pile\\nup more slowly. The coin Moiraine had given him was not among them. Domon had given an equal\\nweight of silver, but Rand, for some reason he could not fathom, wished he had the Aes Sedai’s coin\\ninstead. Stuffing the money in his pocket, he looked a question at the gleeman.\\n“In case we’re separated,” Thom explained. “We probably won’t be, but if it does happen . . .\\nwell, you two will make out all right by yourselves. You’re good lads. Just keep clear of Aes Sedai,\\nfor your lives.”\\n“I thought you were staying with us,” Rand said.\\n“I am, boy. I am. But they’re getting close, now, and the Light only knows. Well, no matter. It\\nisn’t likely anything will happen.” Thom paused, looking at Mat. “I hope you no longer mind me\\nstaying with you,” he said dryly.'),\n",

I can’t seem to get\\nrid of it. Every time we stop for a breath, they’re there, hunting us. I feel like somebody’s staring at\\nthe back of my head all the time. What are we going to do?”\\nThe laughter erupted on the other side of the wall, broken again by Gelb, trying loudly to\\nconvince the two men that he was telling the truth. How much longer, Rand wondered. Sooner or later\\nBartim had to put together Gelb’s three and the three of them.\\nThom eased his chair and rose, but kept his height crouched. No one looking casually toward the\\nwall from the other side could see him. He motioned for them to follow, whispering, “Be very quiet.”\\nThe windows on either side of the fireplace on their side of the wall looked out into an\\nalleyway. Thom studied one of the windows carefully before drawing it up just enough for them to\\nsqueeze through. It barely made a sound, nothing that could have been heard three feet away over the\\nlaughing argument on the other side of the low wall.\\nOnce in the alley, Mat started for the street right away, but Thom caught his arm. “Not so fast,”\\nthe gleeman told him. “Not till we know what we’re doing.” Thom lowered the window again as\\nmuch as he could from outside, and turned to study the alley.\\nRand followed Thom’s eyes. Except for half a dozen rain barrels against the inn and the next\\nbuilding, a tailor shop, the alley was empty, the hard-packed dirt dry and dusty.\\n“Why are you doing this?” Mat demanded again. “You’d be safer if you left us. Why are you\\nstaying with us?”\\nThom stared at him for a long moment. “I had a nephew, Owyn,” he said wearily, shrugging out\\nof his cloak. He made a pile with his blanketroll as he talked, carefully setting his cased instruments\\non top. “My brother’s only son, my only living kin. He got in trouble with the Aes Sedai, but I was too\\nbusy with . . . other things. I don’t know what I could have done, but when I finally tried, it was too\\nlate. Owyn died a few years later. You could say Aes Sedai killed him.” He straightened up, not\\nlooking at them. His voice was still level, but Rand glimpsed tears in his eyes as he turned his head\\naway. “If I can keep you two free of Tar Valon, maybe I can stop thinking about Owyn. Wait here.”\\nStill avoiding their eyes, he hurried to the mouth of the alley, slowing before he reached it. After one\\nquick look around, he strolled casually into the street and out of sight.\\nMat half rose to follow, then settled back. “He won’t leave these,” he said, touching the leather\\ninstrument cases. “You believe that story?”\\nRand squatted patiently beside the rain barrels. “What’s the matter with you, Mat? You aren’t\\nlike this. I haven’t heard you laugh in days.”\\n“I don’t like being hunted like a rabbit,” Mat snapped. He sighed, letting his head fall back\\nagainst the brick wall of the inn. Even like that he seemed tense. His eyes shifted warily. “Sorry. It’s\\nthe running, and all these strangers, and . . . and just everything. It makes me jumpy. I look at\\nsomebody, and I can’t help wondering if he’s going to tell the Fades about us, or cheat us, or rob us,\\nor. . . . Light, Rand, doesn’t it make you nervous?”\\nRand laughed, a quick bark in the back of his throat. “I’m too scared to be nervous.”\\n“What do you think the Aes Sedai did to his nephew?”\\n“I don’t know,” Rand said uneasily. There was only one kind of trouble that he knew of for a\\nman to get into with Aes Sedai. “Not like us, I guess.”\\n“No. Not like us.”\\nFor a time they leaned against the wall, not talking. Rand was not sure how long they waited.

His mouth went dry, and no amount of swallowing helped. Mat rose to a crouch with\\none hand under his cloak.\\nThe man came closer, and Rand’s throat grew tighter with every step. Abruptly the man stopped\\nand tossed back his cowl. Rand’s knees almost gave way. It was Thom.\\n“Well, if you don’t recognize me”—the gleeman grinned—“I guess it’s a good enough disguise\\nfor the gates.”\\nThom pushed past them and began transferring things from his patch-covered cloak to his new\\none so nimbly that Rand could not make out any of them. The new cloak was dark brown, Rand saw\\nnow. He drew a deep, ragged breath; his throat still felt as if it were clutched in a fist. Brown, not\\nblack. Mat still had his hand under his cloak, and he stared at Thom’s back as if he were thinking of\\nusing the hidden dagger.\\nThom glanced up at them, then gave them a sharper look. “This is no time to get skittish.” Deftly\\nhe began folding his old cloak into a bundle around his instrument cases, inside out so the patches\\nwere hidden. “We’ll walk out of here one at a time, just close enough to keep each other in sight.\\nShouldn’t be remembered especially, that way. Can’t you slouch?” he added to Rand. “That height of\\nyours is as bad as a banner.” He slung the bundle across his back and stood, drawing his hood back\\nup. He looked nothing like a white-haired gleeman. He was just another traveler, a man too poor to\\nafford a horse, much less a carriage. “Let’s go. We’ve wasted too much time already.”\\nRand agreed fervently, but even so he hesitated before stepping out of the alley into the square.\\nNone of the sparse scattering of people gave them a second look—most did not look at them at all—\\nbut his shoulders knotted, waiting for the cry of Darkfriend that could turn ordinary people into a mob\\nbent on murder. He ran his eyes across the open area, over people moving about on their daily\\nbusiness, and when he brought them back a Myrddraal was halfway across the square.\\nWhere the Fade had come from, he could not begin to guess, but it strode toward the three of\\nthem with a slow deadliness, a predator with the prey under its gaze. People shied away from the\\nblack-cloaked shape, avoided looking at it. The square began to empty out as people decided they\\nwere needed elsewhere.\\nThe black cowl froze Rand where he stood. He tried to summon up the void, but it was like\\nfumbling after smoke. The Fade’s hidden gaze knifed to his bones and turned his marrow to icicles.\\n“Don’t look at its face,” Thom muttered. His voice shook and cracked, and it sounded as if he\\nwere forcing the words out. “The Light burn you, don’t look at its face!”\\nRand tore his eyes away—he almost groaned; it felt like tearing a leech off of his face—but even\\nstaring at the stones of the square he could still see the Myrddraal coming, a cat playing with mice,\\namused at their feeble efforts to escape, until finally the jaws snapped shut. The Fade had halved the\\ndistance. “Are we just going to stand here?” he mumbled. “We have to run . . . get away.” But he\\ncould not make his feet move.\\nMat had the ruby-hilted dagger out at last, in a trembling hand. His lips were drawn back from\\nhis teeth, a snarl and a rictus of fear.\\n“Think. . . .” Thom stopped to swallow, and went on hoarsely. “Think you can outrun it, do you,\\nboy?” He began to mutter to himself; the only word Rand could make out was “Owyn.” Abruptly\\nThom growled, “I never should have gotten mixed up with you boys. Should never have.” He\\nshrugged the bundled gleeman’s cloak off of his back and thrust it into Rand’s arms. “Take care of'),\n",

His feet felt\\nlike lead weights.\\n“Just remember it!” Thom snarled. “The Queen’s Blessing. Now. RUN!”\\nHe gave them a push, one hand on the shoulder of each of them, to get them started, and Rand\\nstumbled away in a lurching run with Mat at his side.\\n“RUN!” Thom sprang into motion, too, with a long, wordless roar. Not after them, but toward\\nthe Myrddraal. His hands flourished as if he were performing at his best, and daggers appeared. Rand\\nstopped, but Mat pulled him along.\\nThe Fade was just as startled. Its leisurely pace faltered in mid-stride. Its hand swept toward the\\nhilt of the black sword hanging at its waist, but the gleeman’s long legs covered the distance quickly.\\nThom crashed into the Myrddraal before the black blade was half drawn, and both went down in a\\nthrashing heap. The few people still in the square fled.\\n“RUN!” The air in the square flashed an eye-searing blue, and Thom began to scream, but even\\nin the middle of the scream he managed a word. \\n“RUN!”\\nRand obeyed. The gleeman’s screams pursued him.\\nClutching Thom’s bundle to his chest, he ran as hard as he could. Panic spread from the square\\nout through the town as Rand and Mat fled on the crest of a wave of fear. Shopkeepers abandoned\\ntheir goods as the boys passed. Shutters banged down over storefronts, and frightened faces appeared\\nin the windows of houses, then vanished. People who had not been close enough to see ran through\\nthe streets wildly, paying no heed. They bumped into one another, and those who were knocked down\\nscrambled to their feet or were trampled. Whitebridge roiled like a kicked anthill.\\nAs he and Mat pounded toward the gates, Rand abruptly remembered what Thom had said about\\nhis height. Without slowing down, he crouched as best he could without looking as if he was\\ncrouching. But the gates themselves, thick wood bound with black iron straps, stood open. The two\\ngatetenders, in steel caps and mail tunics worn over cheap-looking red coats with white collars,\\nfingered their halberds and stared uneasily into the town. One of them glanced at Rand and Mat, but\\nthey were not the only ones running out of the gates. A steady stream boiled through, panting men\\nclutching wives, weeping women carrying babes and dragging crying children, pale-faced craftsmen\\nstill in their aprons, still heedlessly gripping their tools.\\nThere would be no one who could tell which way they had gone, Rand thought as he ran, dazed.\\nThom. Oh, Light save me, Thom.\\nMat staggered beside him, caught his balance, and they ran until the last of the fleeing people had\\nfallen away, ran until the town and the White Bridge were far out of sight behind them.\\nFinally Rand fell to his knees in the dust, pulling air raggedly into his raw throat with great\\ngulps. The road behind stretched empty until it was lost to sight among bare trees. Mat plucked at him.\\n“Come on. Come on.” Mat panted the words. Sweat and dust streaked his face, and he looked\\nready to collapse. “We have to keep going.”\\n“Thom,” Rand said. He tightened his arms around the bundle of Thom’s cloak; the instrument\\ncases were hard lumps inside. “Thom.”\\n“He’s dead. You saw. You heard. Light, Rand, he’s dead!”\\n“You think Egwene and Moiraine and the rest are dead, too. If they’re dead, why are the\\nMyrddraal still hunting them?

The Traveling People saw no need to hurry; they never did. The colorful wagons did not roll\\nout of a morning until the sun was well above the horizon, and they stopped as early as mid afternoon\\nif they came across a congenial spot. The dogs trotted easily alongside the wagons, and often the\\nchildren did, too. They had no difficulty in keeping up. Any suggestion that they might go further, or\\nmore quickly, was met with laughter, or perhaps, “Ah, but would you make the poor horses work so\\nhard?”\\nHe was surprised that Elyas did not share his feelings. Elyas would not ride on the wagons—he\\npreferred to walk, sometimes loping along at the head of the column—but he never suggested leaving,\\nor pressing on ahead.\\nThe strange bearded man in his strange skin clothes was so different from the gentle Tuatha’an\\nthat he stood out wherever he went among the wagons. Even from across the camp there was no\\nmistaking Elyas for one of the People, and not just because of clothes. Elyas moved with the lazy\\ngrace of a wolf, only emphasized by his skins and his fur hat, radiating danger as naturally as a fire\\nradiated heat, and the contrast with the Traveling People was sharp. Young and old, the People were\\njoyful on their feet. There was no danger in their grace, only delight. Their children darted about\\nfilled with the pure zest of moving, of course, but among the Tuatha’an, graybeards and grandmothers,\\ntoo, still stepped lightly, their walk a stately dance no less exuberant for its dignity. All the People\\nseemed on the point of dancing, even when standing still, even during the rare times when there was\\nno music in the camp. Fiddles and flutes, dulcimers and zithers and drums spun harmony and\\ncounterpoint around the wagons at almost any hour, in camp or on the move. Joyous songs, merry\\nsongs, laughing songs, sad songs; if someone was awake in the camp there was usually music.\\nElyas met friendly nods and smiles at every wagon he passed, and a cheerful word at any fire\\nwhere he paused. This must be the face the People always showed to outsiders—open, smiling faces.\\nBut Perrin had learned that hidden beneath the surface was the wariness of a half-tame deer.\\nSomething deep lay behind the smiles directed at the Emond’s Fielders, something that wondered if\\nthey were safe, something that faded only slightly over the days. With Elyas the wariness was strong,\\nlike deep summer heat shimmering in the air, and it did not fade. When he was not looking they\\nwatched him openly as if unsure what he was going to do. When he walked across the camp, feet\\nready for dancing seemed ready for flight, as well.\\nElyas was certainly no more comfortable with their Way of the Leaf than they were with him.\\nHis mouth wore a permanent twist when he was around the Tuatha’an. It was not quite condescension\\nand certainly not contempt, but looked as though he would rather be elsewhere than where he was,\\nalmost anywhere else. Yet whenever Perrin brought up leaving, Elyas made soothing noises about'),\n",

Perrin still found his yellow-eyed gaze\\ndisconcerting, even when he was smiling. Perhaps even more when he was smiling; smiles seldom\\ntouched those hunter’s eyes. Elyas lounged beside Raen’s fire, as usual refusing to sit on the logs\\ndrawn up for the purpose. “Don’t be in such a bloody hurry to put yourself in Aes Sedai hands.”\\n“What if the Fades find us? What’s to keep them from it if we just sit here, waiting? Three\\nwolves can’t hold them off, and the Traveling People won’t be any help. They won’t even defend\\nthemselves. The Trollocs will butcher them, and it will be our fault. Anyway, we have to leave them\\nsooner or later. It might as well be sooner.”\\n“Something tells me to wait. Just a few days.”\\n“Something!”\\n“Relax, lad. Take life as it comes. Run when you have to, fight when you must, rest when you\\ncan.”\\n“What are you talking about, something?”\\n“Have some of this pie. Ila doesn’t like me, but she surely feeds me well when I visit. Always\\ngood food in the People’s camps.”\\n“What ‘something’?” Perrin demanded. “If you know something you aren’t telling the rest of\\nus. . . .”\\nElyas frowned at the piece of pie in his hand, then set it down and dusted his hands together.\\n“Something,” he said finally, with a shrug of his shoulders as if he did not understand it completely\\nhimself. “Something tells me it’s important to wait. A few more days. I don’t get feelings like this\\noften, but when I do, I’ve learned to trust them. They’ve saved my life in the past. This time it’s\\ndifferent, somehow, but it’s important. That’s clear. You want to run on, then run on. Not me.”\\nThat was all he would say, no matter how many times Perrin asked. He lay about, talking with\\nRaen, eating, napping with his hat over his eyes, and refused to discuss leaving. Something told him to\\nwait. Something told him it was important. He would know when it was time to go. Have some pie,\\nlad. Don’t lather yourself. Try some of this stew. Relax.\\nPerrin could not make himself relax. At night he wandered among the rainbow wagons worrying,\\nas much because no one else seemed to see anything to worry about as for any other reason. The\\nTuatha’an sang and danced, cooked and ate around their campfires—fruits and nuts, berries and\\nvegetables; they ate no meat—and went about a myriad domestic chores as if they had not a care in\\nthe world. The children ran and played everywhere, hide-and-seek among the wagons, climbing in the\\ntrees around the camp, laughing and rolling on the ground with the dogs. Not a care in the world, for\\nanyone.\\nWatching them, he itched to get away. \\nGo, before we bring the hunters down on them. They\\ntook us in, and we repay their kindness by endangering them. At least they have reason to be\\nlighthearted. Nothing is hunting them. But the rest of us.\\n . . .\\nIt was hard to get a word with Egwene. Either she was talking with Ila, their heads together in a\\nway that said no men were welcome, or she was dancing with Aram, swinging round and round to the\\nflutes and fiddles and drums, to tunes the Tuatha’an had gathered from all over the world, or to the\\nsharp, trilling songs of the Traveling People themselves, sharp whether they were quick or slow.\\nThey knew many songs, some he recognized from home, though often under different names than they\\nwere called in the Two Rivers. “Three Girls in the Meadow,” for instance, the Tinkers named “Pretty'),\n",

When he asked, not thinking, for “The Tinker Has My Pots,”\\nthey fell all over themselves laughing. They knew it, but as “Toss the Feathers.”\\nHe could understand wanting to dance to the People’s songs. Back in Emond’s Field no one\\nconsidered him more than an adequate dancer, but these songs tugged at his feet, and he thought he had\\nnever danced so long, or so hard, or so well in his life. Hypnotic, they made his blood pound in\\nrhythm to the drums.\\nIt was the second evening when for the first time Perrin saw women dance to some of the slow\\nsongs. The fires burned low, and the night hung close around the wagons, and fingers tapped a slow\\nrhythm on the drums. First one drum, then another, until every drum in the camp kept the same low,\\ninsistent beat. There was silence except for the drums. A girl in a red dress swayed into the light,\\nloosening her shawl. Strings of beads hung in her hair, and she had kicked off her shoes. A flute began\\nthe melody, wailing softly, and the girl danced. Outstretched arms spread her shawl behind her; her\\nhips undulated as her bare feet shuffled to the beat of the drums. The girl’s dark eyes fastened on\\nPerrin, and her smile was as slow as her dance. She turned in small circles, smiling over her shoulder\\nat him.\\nHe swallowed hard. The heat in his face was not from the fire. A second girl joined the first, the\\nfringe on their shawls shaking in time to the drums and the slow rotation of their hips. They smiled at\\nhim, and he cleared his throat hoarsely. He was afraid to look around; his face was as red as a beet,\\nand anyone who was not watching the dancers was probably laughing at him. He was sure of it.\\nAs casually as he could manage, he slid off the log as if he were just getting comfortable, but he\\ncarefully ended up looking away from the fire, away from the dancers. There was nothing like that in\\nEmond’s Field. Dancing with the girls on the Green on a feastday did not even come close. For once\\nhe wished that the wind would pick up, to cool him off.\\nThe girls danced into his field of view again, only now they were three. One gave him a sly\\nwink. His eyes darted frantically. \\nLight,\\n he thought. \\nWhat do I do now? What would Rand do? He\\nknows about girls.\\nThe dancing girls laughed softly; beads clicked as they tossed their long hair on their shoulders,\\nand he thought his face would burn up. Then a slightly older woman joined the girls, to show them\\nhow it was done. With a groan, he gave up altogether and shut his eyes. Even behind his eyelids their\\nlaughter taunted and tickled. Even behind his eyelids he could still see them. Sweat beaded on his\\nforehead, and he wished for the wind.\\nAccording to Raen the girls did not dance that dance often, and the women rarely did, and\\naccording to Elyas it was thanks to Perrin’s blushes that they did so every night thereafter.\\n“I have to thank you,” Elyas told him, his tone sober and solemn. “It’s different with you young\\nfellows, but at my age it takes more than a fire to warm my bones.” Perrin scowled. There was\\nsomething about Elyas’s back as he walked away that said even if nothing showed, he was laughing\\ninside.\\nPerrin soon learned better than to look away from the dancing women and girls, though the winks\\nand smiles still made him wish he could. One would have been all right, maybe—but five or six, with\\neveryone watching. . . . He never did entirely conquer his blushes.\\nThen Egwene began learning the dance. Two of the girls who had danced that first night taught\\nher, clapping the rhythm while she repeated the shuffling steps with a borrowed shawl swaying\\nbehind her. Perrin started to say something, then decided it was wiser not to crack his teeth. When the\\ngirls added the hip movements Egwene started laughing, and the three girls fell giggling into one'),\n",

But Egwene persevered, with her eyes glistening and bright spots of color in her\\ncheeks.\\nAram watched her dancing with a hot, hungry gaze. The handsome young Tuatha’an had given\\nher a string of blue beads that she wore all the time. Worried frowns now replaced the smiles Ila had\\nworn when she first noticed her grandson’s interest in Egwene. Perrin resolved to keep a close eye on\\nyoung Master Aram.\\nOnce he managed to get Egwene alone, beside a wagon painted in green and yellow. “Enjoying\\nyourself, aren’t you?” he said.\\n“Why shouldn’t I?” She fingered the blue beads around her neck, smiling at them. “We don’t all\\nhave to work at being miserable, the way you do. Don’t we deserve a little chance to enjoy\\nourselves?”\\nAram stood not far off—he never got far from Egwene—with his arms folded across his chest, a\\nlittle smile on his face, half smugness and half challenge. Perrin lowered his voice. “I thought you\\nwanted to get to Tar Valon. You won’t learn to be an Aes Sedai here.”\\nEgwene tossed her head. “And I thought you didn’t like me wanting to become an Aes Sedai,”\\nshe said, too sweetly.\\n“Blood and ashes, do you believe we’re safe here? Are these people safe with us here? A Fade\\ncould find us anytime.”\\nHer hand trembled on the beads. She lowered it and took a deep breath. “Whatever is going to\\nhappen will happen whether we leave today or next week. That’s what I believe now. Enjoy yourself,\\nPerrin. It might be the last chance we have.”\\nShe brushed his cheek sadly with her fingers. Then Aram held out his hand to her, and she darted\\nto him, already laughing again. As they ran away to where fiddles sang, Aram flashed a triumphant\\ngrin over his shoulder at Perrin as if to say, she is not yours, but she will be mine.\\nThey were all falling too much under the spell of the People, Perrin thought. \\nElyas is right. They\\ndon’t have to try to convert you to the Way of the Leaf. It seeps into you.\\nIla had taken one look at him huddling out of the wind, then produced a thick wool cloak out of\\nher wagon; a dark green cloak, he was pleased to see, after all the reds and yellows. As he swung it\\nround his shoulders, thinking what a wonder it was that the cloak was big enough for him, Ila said\\nprimly, “It could fit better.” She glanced at the axe at his belt, and when she looked up at him her eyes\\nwere sad above her smile. “It could fit much better.”\\nAll the Tinkers did that. Their smiles never slipped, there was never any hesitation in their\\ninvitations to join them for a drink or to listen to the music, but their eyes always touched the axe, and\\nhe could feel what they thought. A tool of violence. There is never any excuse for violence to another\\nhuman being. The Way of the Leaf.\\nSometimes he wanted to shout at them. There were Trollocs in the world, and Fades. There\\nwere those who would cut down every leaf. The Dark One was out there, and the Way of the Leaf\\nwould burn in Ba’alzamon’s eyes. Stubbornly he continued to wear the axe. He took to keeping his\\ncloak thrown back, even when it was windy, so the half-moon blade was never hidden. Now and\\nagain Elyas looked quizzically at the weapon hanging heavy at his side and grinned at him, those\\nyellow eyes seeming to read his mind. That almost made him cover the axe. Almost.\\nIf the Tuatha’an camp was a source of constant irritation, at least his dreams were normal there.\\nSometimes he woke up sweating from a dream of Trollocs and Fades storming into the camp,\\nrainbow-colored wagons turning to bonfires from hurled torches, people falling in pools of blood,\\nmen and women and children who ran and screamed and died but made no effort to defend themselves'),\n",

Night after night he bolted upright in the dark, panting and\\nreaching for his axe before he realized the wagons were not in flames, that no bloody-muzzled shapes\\nsnarled over torn and twisted bodies littering the ground. But those were ordinary nightmares, and\\noddly comforting in their way. If there was ever a place for the Dark One to be in his dreams, it was\\nin those, but he was not. No Ba’alzamon. Just ordinary nightmares.\\nHe was aware of the wolves, though, when he was awake. They kept their distance from the\\ncamps, and from the caravan on the move, but he always knew where they were. He could feel their\\ncontempt for the dogs guarding the Tuatha’an. Noisy beasts who had forgotten what their jaws were\\nfor, had forgotten the taste of warm blood; they might frighten humans, but they would slink away on\\ntheir bellies if the pack ever came. Each day his awareness was sharper, more clear.\\nDapple grew more impatient with every sunset. That Elyas wanted to do this thing of taking the\\nhumans south made it worth doing, but if it must be done, then let it be done. Let this slow travel end.\\nWolves were meant to roam, and she did not like being away from the pack so long. Impatience\\nburned in Wind, too. Hunting was worse than poor here, and he despised living on field mice,\\nsomething for cubs to stalk while learning to hunt, fit food for the old, no longer able to pull down a\\ndeer or hamstring a wild ox. Sometimes Wind thought that Burn had been right; leave human troubles\\nto humans. But he was wary of such thoughts when Dapple was around, and even more so around\\nHopper. Hopper was a scarred and grizzled fighter, impassive with the knowledge of years, with\\nguile that more than made up for anything of which age might have robbed him. For humans he cared\\nnothing, but Dapple wished this thing done, and Hopper would wait as she waited and run as she ran.\\nWolf or man, bull or bear, Whatever challenged Dapple would find Hopper’s jaws waiting to send\\nhim to the long sleep. That was the whole of life for Hopper, and that kept Wind cautious, and Dapple\\nseemed to ignore the thoughts of both.\\nAll of it was clear in Perrin’s mind. Fervently he wished for Caemlyn, for Moiraine and Tar\\nValon. Even if there were no answers, there could be an end to it. Elyas looked at him, and he was\\nsure the yellow-eyed man knew. \\nPlease, let there be an end.\\nThe dream began more pleasantly than most he had of late. He was at Alsbet Luhhan’s kitchen\\ntable, sharpening his axe with a stone. Mistress Luhhan never allowed forge work, or anything that\\nsmacked of it, to be brought into the house. Master Luhhan even had to take her knives outside to\\nsharpen them. But she tended her cooking and never said a word about the axe. She did not even say\\nanything when a wolf entered from deeper in the house and curled up between Perrin and the door to\\nthe yard. Perrin went on sharpening; it would be time to use it, soon.\\nAbruptly the wolf rose, rumbling deep in its throat, the thick ruff of fur on its neck rising.\\nBa’alzamon stepped into the kitchen from the yard. Mistress Luhhan went on with her cooking.\\nPerrin scrambled to his feet, raising the axe, but Ba’alzamon ignored the weapon, concentrating\\non the wolf, instead. Flames danced where his eyes should be. “Is this what you have to protect you?\\nWell, I have faced this before. Many times before.”\\nHe crooked a finger, and the wolf howled as fire burst out of its eyes and ears and mouth, out of\\nits skin. The stench of burning meat and hair filled the kitchen. Alsbet Luhhan lifted the lid on a pot\\nand stirred with a wooden spoon.\\nPerrin dropped the axe and jumped forward, trying to beat out the flames with his hands. The\\nwolf crumpled to black ash between his palms. Staring at the shapeless pile of char on Mistress\\nLuhhan’s clean-swept floor, he backed away. He wished he could wipe the greasy soot from his\\nhands, but the thought of scrubbing it off on his clothes turned his stomach. He snatched up the axe,\\ngripping the haft until his knuckles cracked.'),\n",

Mistress Luhhan opened the oven to check her bread. “The Eye of the World will\\nconsume you,” Ba’alzamon said. “I mark you mine!” He flung out his clenched hand as if throwing\\nsomething; when his fingers opened, a raven streaked at Perrin’s face.\\nPerrin screamed as the black beak pierced his left eye . . .\\n. . . and sat up, clutching his face, surrounded by the sleeping wagons of the Traveling People.\\nSlowly he lowered his hands.

The Seeker glanced at the sky and froze halfway down the\\nsteps, his hands still raised to his face. Only his eyes moved as he studied the sky intently, though\\nPerrin could not understand what he was looking at. A few clouds hung in the east, undersides\\nstreaked with pink from the sun yet to rise, but there was nothing else to see. Raen seemed to listen, as\\nwell, and smell the air, but there was no sound except the wind in the trees and no smell but the faint\\nsmoky remnant of last night’s campfires.\\nElyas returned with his own scanty belongings, and Raen came the rest of the way down. “We\\nmust change the direction we travel, my old friend.” The Seeker looked uneasily at the sky again. “We\\ngo another way this day. Will you be coming with us?” Elyas shook his head, and Raen nodded as if\\nhe had known all along. “Well, take care, my old friend.

Perhaps all the way to the Spine of the World. Perhaps we’ll find a\\nstedding,\\n and stay there awhile.”\\n“Trouble never enters the \\nstedding,\\n” Elyas agreed. “But the Ogier are none too open to\\nstrangers.”\\n“Everyone is open to the Traveling People,” Raen said, and grinned. “Besides, even Ogier have\\npots and things to mend. Come, let us have some breakfast, and we’ll talk about it.”\\n“No time,” Elyas said. “We move on today, too. As soon as possible. It’s a day for moving, it\\nseems.”\\nRaen tried to convince him to at least stay long enough for food, and when Ila appeared from the\\nwagon with Egwene, she added her arguments, though not as strenuously as her husband. She said all\\nof the right words, but her politeness was stiff, and it was plain she would be glad to see Elyas’s\\nback, if not Egwene’s.\\nEgwene did not notice the regretful, sidelong looks Ila gave her. She asked what was going on,\\nand Perrin prepared himself for her to say she wanted to stay with the Tuatha’an, but when Elyas\\nexplained she only nodded thoughtfully and hurried back into the wagon to gather her things.\\nFinally Raen threw up his hands. “All right. I don’t know that I have ever let a visitor leave this\\ncamp without a farewell feast, but. . . .” Uncertainly, his eyes raised toward the sky again. “Well, we\\nneed an early start ourselves, I think.

His face shifted from pleading to arguing, but she continued to shake her head stubbornly\\nuntil Ila rescued her with a few sharp words to her grandson.

The Way of the Leaf is peace.”\\n“Peace be on you always,” Elyas replied, “and on all the People.” He hesitated, then added, “I\\nwill find the song, or another will find the song, but the song will be sung, this year or in a year to\\ncome. As it once was, so shall it be again, world without end.”\\nRaen blinked in surprise, and Ila looked completely flabbergasted, but all the other Tuatha’an\\nmurmured in reply, “World without end. World and time without end.” Raen and his wife hurriedly\\nsaid the same after everyone else.\\nThen it really was time to go. A few last farewells, a few last admonitions to take care, a few\\nlast smiles and winks, and they were making their way out of the camp. Raen accompanied them as\\nfar as the edge of the trees, a pair of the dogs cavorting by his side.\\n“Truly, my old friend, you must take great care. This day. . . . There is wickedness loose in the\\nworld, I fear, and Whatever you pretend, you are not so wicked that it will not gobble you up.”\\n“Peace be on you,” Elyas said.\\n“And on you,” Raen said sadly.\\nWhen Raen was gone, Elyas scowled at finding the other two looking at him. “So I don’t believe\\nin their fool song,” he growled. “No need to make them feel bad by messing up their ceremony, was\\nthere?

She would go there, if need be, and take their\\ntraining, but not for the reasons the Aes Sedai thought. If Moiraine had brought harm to Egwene and\\nthe boys. . . .\\nSometimes, against her will, Nynaeve had found herself thinking of what a Wisdom could do\\nwith the One Power, of what she could do. Whenever she realized what was in her head, though, a\\nflash of anger burned it out. The Power was a filthy thing. She would have nothing to do with it.\\nUnless she had to.\\nThe cursed woman only wanted to talk about taking her to Tar Valon for training. Moiraine\\nwould not tell her anything! It was not as if she wanted to know so much.\\n“How do you mean to find them?” she remembered demanding.\\n“As I have told you,” Moiraine replied without bothering to look back at her, “I will know when\\nI am close to the two who have lost their coins.” It was not the first time Nynaeve had asked, but the\\nAes Sedai’s voice was like a still pond that refused to ripple no matter how many stones Nynaeve\\nthrew; it made the Wisdom’s blood boil every time she was exposed to it. Moiraine went on as if she\\ncould not feel Nynaeve’s eyes on her back; Nynaeve knew she must be able to, she was staring so\\nhard. “The longer it takes, the closer I must come, but I will know. As for the one who still has his\\ntoken, so long as he has it in his possession I can follow him across half the world, if need be.”\\n“And then? What do you plan when you’ve found them, Aes Sedai?” She did not for a minute\\nbelieve the Aes Sedai would be so intent on finding them if she did not have plans.\\n“Tar Valon, Wisdom.”\\n“Tar Valon, Tar Valon. That’s all you ever say, and I am becoming—”\\n“Part of the training you will receive in Tar Valon, Wisdom, will teach you to control your\\ntemper.

The scowl made her feel like a girl who had been caught acting the fool by someone in the\\nWomen’s Circle. That was a feeling Nynaeve was not used to, and the calm smile on Moiraine’s face\\nonly made it worse.\\nIf only there was some way to get rid of the woman. Lan would be better by himself—a Warder\\nshould be able to handle what was needed, she told herself hastily, feeling a sudden flush; no other\\nreason—but one meant the other.\\nAnd yet, Lan made her even more furious than Moiraine.

The wind seemed distant, too, even when it was\\ncutting through the cloak on her back.\\nAt first the stillness was restful after everything that had happened. It seemed as if she had not\\nknown a moment of quiet since before Winternight. By the end of the first day alone with the Aes\\nSedai and the Warder, though, she was looking over her shoulder and fidgeting in her saddle as if she\\nhad an itch in the middle of her back where she could not reach. The silence seemed like crystal\\ndoomed to shatter, and waiting for the first crack put her teeth on edge.\\nIt weighed on Moiraine and Lan, too, as outwardly unperturbable as they were. She soon\\nrealized that, beneath their calm surfaces, hour by hour they wound tighter and tighter, like\\nclocksprings being forced to the breaking point. Moiraine seemed to listen to things that were not\\nthere, and what she heard put a crease in her forehead. Lan watched the forest and the river as if the\\nleafless trees and wide, slow water carried the signs of traps and ambushes waiting ahead.\\nPart of her was glad that she was not the only one who apprehended that poised-on-the-brink\\nfeel to the world, but if it affected them, it was real, and another part of her wanted nothing so much\\nas for it to be just her imagination.

Peering through a clump\\nof thorny weeds, Perrin saw only the same rolling plain that lay behind them. The down-slope was\\nbare, though a clump of trees a hundred paces across grew in the hollow, perhaps half a mile south\\nfrom the ridge. The wolves had already been through it, smelling no trace of Trollocs or Myrddraal.\\nEast and west the land was the same as far as Perrin could see, rolling grassland and wide-\\nscattered thickets. Nothing moved. The wolves were more than a mile ahead, out of sight; at that\\ndistance he could barely feel them. They had seen nothing when they covered this ground. \\nWhat is he\\nlooking for? There’s nothing there.\\n“We’re wasting time,” he said, starting to stand, and a flock of ravens burst out of the trees\\nbelow, fifty, a hundred black birds, spiraling into the sky. He froze in a crouch as they milled over the\\ntrees. \\nThe Dark One’s Eyes. Did they see me?\\n Sweat trickled down his face.\\nAs if one thought had suddenly sparked in a hundred tiny minds, every raven broke sharply in the\\nsame direction. South. The flock disappeared over the next rise, already descending. To the east\\nanother thicket disgorged more ravens. The black mass wheeled twice and headed south.\\nShaking, he lowered himself to the ground slowly. He tried to speak, but his mouth was too dry.\\nAfter a minute he managed to work up some spit. “Was that what you were afraid of? Why didn’t you\\nsay something? Why didn’t the wolves see them?”\\n“Wolves don’t look up in trees much,” Elyas growled. “And no, I wasn’t looking for this. I told'),\n",

Elyas wanted Dapple and her\\ncompanions to quit scouting ahead, to hurry back and check their backtrail. His already gaunt face\\ntightened and thinned under the strain. The wolves were so far away Perrin could not even feel them.\\nHurry. Watch the sky. Hurry.\\nFaintly Perrin caught the reply from far to the south. \\nWe come.\\n An image flashed in his mind—\\nwolves running, muzzles pointing into the wind of their haste, running as if wildfire raced behind,\\nrunning—flashed and was gone in an instant.\\nElyas slumped and drew a deep breath. Frowning, he peered over the ridge, then back to the\\nnorth, and muttered under his breath.\\n“You think there are more ravens behind us?” Perrin asked.\\n“Could be,” Elyas said vaguely. “They do it that way, sometimes. I know a place, if we can\\nreach it by dark. We have to keep moving until full dark anyway, even if we don’t get there, but we\\ncan’t go as fast as I would like. Can’t afford to get too close to the ravens ahead of us. But if they’re\\nbehind us, too. . . .”\\n“Why dark?” Perrin said. “What place? Somewhere safe from the ravens?”\\n“Safe from ravens,” Elyas said, “but too many people know. . . . Ravens roost for the night. We\\ndon’t have to worry about them finding us in the dark. The Light send ravens are all we have to worry\\nabout then.” With one more look over the crest, he rose and waved to Egwene to bring Bela up. “But\\ndark is a long way off. We have to get moving.” He started down the far slope in a shambling run,\\neach stride barely catching him on the edge of falling. “Move, burn you!”\\nPerrin moved, half running, half sliding, after him.\\nEgwene topped the rise behind them, kicking Bela to a trot. A grin of relief bloomed on her face\\nwhen she saw them. “What’s going on?” she called, urging the shaggy mare to catch up. “When you\\ndisappeared like that, I thought. . . . What happened?”\\nPerrin saved his breath for running until she reached them. He explained about the ravens and\\nElyas’s safe place, but it was a disjointed story. After a strangled, “Ravens!” she kept interrupting\\nwith questions for which, as often as not, he had no answers. Between them, he did not finish until\\nthey reached the next ridge.\\nOrdinarily—if anything about the journey could be called ordinary—they would have gone\\naround this one rather than over, but Elyas insisted on scouting anyway.\\n“You want to just saunter right into the middle of them, boy?” was his sour comment.\\nEgwene stared at the crest of the ridge, licking her lips, as if she wanted to go with Elyas this\\ntime and wanted to stay where she was, too. Elyas was the only one who showed no hesitation.\\nPerrin wondered if the ravens ever doubled back. It would be a fine thing to reach the crest at\\nthe same time as a flock of ravens.\\nAt the top he inched his head up until he could just see, and heaved a sigh of relief when all he\\nsaw was a copse of trees a little to the west.

The beat of their wings almost\\ndrowned out a desperate whining from the fox. A black whirlwind dove and swirled around it. The\\nfox’s jaws snapped at them, but they darted in, and darted away untouched, black beaks glistening\\nwetly. The fox turned back toward the trees, seeking the safety of its den. It ran awkwardly now, head\\nlow, fur dark and bloody, and the ravens flapped around it, more and more of them at once, the\\nfluttering mass thickening until it hid the fox completely. As suddenly as they had descended the\\nravens rose, wheeled, and vanished over the next rise to the south.

He was still\\ntrying to get a stone from his pocket to the sling when the raven abruptly folded up in mid-air and\\nplummeted to the ground. His mouth dropped open, and then he saw the sling hanging from Egwene’s\\nhand. She grinned at him unsteadily.\\n“Don’t stand there counting your toes!” Elyas called.\\nWith a start Perrin hurried into the trees, then jumped out of the way to avoid being trampled by\\nEgwene and Bela.\\nFar to the west, almost out of sight, what seemed like a dark mist rose into the air. Perrin felt the\\nwolves passing in that direction, heading north. He felt them notice ravens, to the left and right of\\nthem, without slowing. The dark mist swirled northward as if pursuing the wolves, then abruptly\\nbroke off and flashed to the south.\\n“Do you think they saw us?” Egwene asked. “We were already in the trees, weren’t we? They\\ncouldn’t see us at that distance. Could they? Not that far off.”\\n“We saw them at that distance,” Elyas said dryly. Perrin shifted uneasily, and Egwene drew a\\nfrightened breath. “If they had seen us,” Elyas growled, “they’d have been down on us like they were\\non that fox. Think, if you want to stay alive.

Might be useful again.”\\nAs they moved out of the copse, Elyas angled them westward from the line of march they had\\nbeen following.

To the left and right the black\\nbirds billowed up, and to the south. A dozen times they reached the hiding place of a grove or the\\nscant shelter of a slope only moments before ravens swept into the sky. Once, with the sun beginning\\nto slide from its midday height, they stood in the open, frozen as still as statues, half a mile from the\\nnearest cover, while a hundred of the Dark One’s feathered spies flashed by a bare mile to the east.\\nSweat rolled down Perrin’s face despite the wind, until the last black shape dwindled to a dot and\\nvanished. He lost count of the stragglers they brought down with their slings.\\nHe saw more than enough evidence lying in the path the ravens had covered to justify his fear.\\nHe had stared with a queasy fascination at a rabbit that had been torn to pieces. The eyeless head\\nstood upright, with the other bits—legs, entrails—scattered in a rough circle around it. Birds, too,\\nstabbed to shapeless masses of feathers.

The wolves had found ravens to the north. Screaming birds dove and whirled and\\ndove again, beaks drawing blood with every swoop.

Again and again Perrin tasted feathers and the foul taste of fluttering ravens\\ncrushed alive, felt the pain of oozing gashes all over his body, knew with a despair that never touched\\non giving up that all his effort was not enough.

In the last minutes, when the ravens descended on them, when all hope was gone, would he\\nhave the courage to spare her the death the fox had died? \\nLight make me strong!\\nThe ravens ahead of them suddenly seemed to vanish. Perrin could still make out dark, misty\\nclouds, far to the east and west, but ahead . . . nothing. \\nWhere did they go?

Then he noticed green shoots among the grass; not many, and they were\\nstruggling, but more than he had seen anywhere else. There were fewer weeds in the grass, too. He\\ncould not imagine what it was, but there was . . . something about this place. And something in what\\nElyas said tickled his memory.\\n“What is it?” Egwene asked. “I feel. . . .

Elyas settled into an effortless lope, only slowing\\nto a walk when it became apparent the others could not keep up. A fast walk.\\n“Why don’t—we stay here?” Perrin panted. He was breathing through his mouth, and he forced\\nthe words out between deep, wracking breaths. “If it’s really—a \\nstedding.\\n We’d be safe. No\\nTrollocs. No Aes Sedai. Why don’t we—just stay here—until it’s all over?” \\nMaybe the wolves\\nwon’t come here, either.\\n“How long will that be?” Elyas looked over his shoulder with one eyebrow raised. “What\\nwould you eat? Grass, like the horse? Besides, there’s others know about this place, and nothing\\nkeeps men out, not even the worst of them. And there is only one place where there’s still water to be\\nfound.” Frowning uneasily, he turned in a complete circle, scanning the land. When he was done, he\\nshook his head and muttered to himself. Perrin felt him calling to the wolves. \\nHurry. Hurry.\\n “We take\\nour chances on a choice of evils, and the ravens are sure.

There was\\nnothing left but cheese and dried meat; there had been no chance to hunt. At least there was still tea.\\nPerrin did his share, but silently.

There were no trees, but he had snapped dead\\nbranches from the brush and built his fire against a huge chunk of rock sticking out of the hillside.\\nFrom the layers of soot staining the stone, Perrin thought the site must have been used by generation\\nafter generation of travelers.\\nWhat showed above ground of the big rock was rounded somewhat, with a sharp break on one\\nside where moss, old and brown, covered the ragged surface. The grooves and hollows eroded in the\\nrounded part looked odd to Perrin, but he was too absorbed in gloom to wonder about it. Egwene,\\nthough, studied it as she ate.\\n“That,” she said finally, “looks like an eye.” Perrin blinked; it \\ndid\\n look like an eye, under all that\\nsoot.\\n“It is,” Elyas said. He sat with his back to the fire and the rock, studying the land around them\\nwhile he chewed a strip of dried meat almost as tough as leather. “Artur Hawkwing’s eye. The eye of\\nthe High King himself. This is what his power and glory came to, in the end.” He said it absently.\\nEven his chewing was absentminded; his eyes and his attention were on the hills.\\n“Artur Hawkwing!” Egwene exclaimed. “You’re joking with me. It isn’t an eye at all. Why\\nwould somebody carve Artur Hawkwing’s eye on a rock out here?”\\nElyas glanced over his shoulder at her, muttering, “What do they teach you village whelps?” He\\nsnorted and straightened back to his watching, but he went on talking. “Artur Paendrag Tanreall, Artur\\nHawkwing, the High King, united all the lands from the Great Blight to the Sea of Storms, from the\\nAryth Ocean to the Aiel Waste, and even some beyond the Waste. He even sent armies the other side\\nof the Aryth Ocean. The stories say he ruled the whole world, but what he really did rule was enough\\nfor any man outside of a story. And he brought peace and justice to the land.”\\n“All stood equal before the law,” Egwene said, “and no man raised his hand against another.”\\n“So you’ve heard the stories, at least.” Elyas chuckled, a dry sound. “Artur Hawkwing brought\\npeace and justice, but he did it with fire and sword. A child could ride alone with a bag of gold from\\nthe Aryth Ocean to the Spine of the World and never have a moment’s fear, but the High King’s\\njustice was as hard as that rock there for anyone who challenged his power, even if it was just by\\nbeing who they were, or by people thinking they were a challenge. The common folk had peace, and\\njustice, and full bellies, but he laid a twenty-year siege to Tar Valon and put a price of a thousand\\ngold crowns on the head of every Aes Sedai.”'),\n",

Artur Hawkwing was a proud fool. An\\nAes Sedai healer could have saved him when he took sick—or was poisoned, as some say—but\\nevery Aes Sedai still alive was penned up behind the Shining Walls, using all their Power to hold off\\nan army that lit up the night with their campfires. He wouldn’t have let one near him, anyway. He\\nhated Aes Sedai as much as he hated the Dark One.”\\nEgwene’s mouth tightened, but when she spoke, all she said was, “What does all that have to do\\nwith whether that’s Artur Hawkwing’s eye?”\\n“Just this, girl. With peace except for what was going on across the ocean, with the people\\ncheering him wherever he went—they really loved him, you see; he was a harsh man, but never with\\nthe common folk—well, with all of that, he decided it was time to build himself a capital. A new city,\\nnot connected in any man’s mind with any old cause or faction or rivalry. Here, he’d build it, at the\\nvery center of the land bordered by the seas and the Waste and the Blight. Here, where no Aes Sedai\\nwould ever come willing or could use the Power if they did. A capital from which, one day, the\\nwhole world would receive peace and justice. When they heard the proclamation, the common people\\nsubscribed enough money to build a monument to him. Most of them looked on him as only a step\\nbelow the Creator. A short step. It took five years to carve and build. A statue of Hawkwing, himself,\\na hundred times bigger than the man. They raised it right here, and the city was to rise around it.”\\n“There was never any city here,” Egwene scoffed. “There would have to be something left if\\nthere was. Something.”\\nElyas nodded, still keeping his watch. “Indeed there was not. Artur Hawkwing died the very day\\nthe statue was finished, and his sons and the rest of his blood fought over who would sit on\\nHawkwing’s throne. The statue stood alone in the midst of these hills. The sons and the nephews and\\nthe cousins died, and the last of the Hawkwing’s blood vanished from the earth—except maybe for\\nsome of those who went over the Aryth Ocean. There were those who would have erased even the\\nmemory of him, if they could. Books were burned just because they mentioned his name. In the end\\nthere was nothing left of him but the stories, and most of them wrong. That’s what his glory came to.\\n“The fighting didn’t stop, of course, just because the Hawkwing and his kin were dead. There\\nwas still a throne to be won, and every lord and lady who could muster fighting men wanted it. It was\\nthe beginning of the War of the Hundred Years. Lasted a hundred and twenty-three, really, and most of\\nthe history of that time is lost in the smoke of burning towns. Many got a part of the land, but none got\\nthe whole, and sometime during those years the statue was pulled down. Maybe they couldn’t stand\\nmeasuring themselves against it any longer.”\\n“First you sound as if you despise him,” Egwene said, “and now you sound as if you admire\\nhim.” She shook her head.\\nElyas turned to look at her, a flat, unblinking stare. “Get some more tea now, if you want any.

Day was fading, and the night wind was already rising out of the east, ruffling the surface of\\nthe water. He took the axe from the loop on his belt and turned it over in his hands. The ashwood haft\\nwas as long as his arm, and smooth and cool to the touch. He hated it. He was ashamed of how proud\\nhe had been of the axe back in Emond’s Field. Before he knew what he might be willing to do with it.\\n“You hate her that much?” Elyas said behind him.\\nStartled, he jumped and half raised the axe before he saw who it was. “Can . . . ? Can you read\\nmy mind, too? Like the wolves?”\\nElyas cocked his head to one side and eyed him quizzically. “A blind man could read your face,\\nboy. Well, speak up. Do you hate the girl? Despise her? That’s it. You were ready to kill her because\\nyou despise her, always dragging her feet, holding you back with her womanish ways.”\\n“Egwene never dragged her feet in her life,” he protested. “She always does her share. I don’t\\ndespise her, I love her.” He glared at Elyas, daring him to laugh. “Not like that. I mean, she isn’t like\\na sister, but she and Rand. . . . Blood and ashes! If the ravens caught us. . . . If. . . . I don’t know.”\\n“Yes, you do. If she had to choose her way of dying, which do you think she’d pick? One clean\\nblow of your axe, or the way the animals we saw today died? I know which I’d take.”\\n“I don’t have any right to choose for her. You won’t tell her, will you? About. . . .” His hands\\ntightened on the axe haft; the muscles in his arms corded, heavy muscles for his age, built by long\\nhours swinging the hammer at Master Luhhan’s forge. For an instant he thought the thick wooden shaft\\nwould snap. “I hate this bloody thing,” he growled. “I don’t know what I’m doing with it, strutting\\naround like some kind of fool. I couldn’t have done it, you know. When it was all pretend and maybe,\\nI could swagger, and play as if I. . . .” He sighed, his voice fading. “It’s different, now. I don’t ever\\nwant to use it again.”\\n“You’ll use it.”\\nPerrin raised the axe to throw it in the pool, but Elyas caught his wrist.\\n“You’ll use it, boy, and as long as you hate using it, you will use it more wisely than most men\\nwould. Wait. If ever you don’t hate it any longer, then will be the time to throw it as far as you can\\nand run the other way.”\\nPerrin hefted the axe in his hands, still tempted to leave it in the pool. \\nEasy for him to say wait.\\nWhat if I wait and then\\n can’t \\nthrow it away?\\nHe opened his mouth to ask Elyas, but no words came out.

Elyas did not pause; as soon as the veil lifted\\nfrom his eyes, he sped toward the fire without any hesitation. Perrin ran wordlessly behind him.\\n“Douse the fire!” Elyas called hoarsely to Egwene.

He was\\nfrightened, too, but fear made them move faster. He waited until they were headed toward the setting\\nsun. Trotting ahead of Bela and holding the axe across his chest in both hands, he told what he knew\\nover his shoulder in snatches while hunting for a place to go to ground and wait for Elyas.\\n“There are a lot of men coming, on horses. They came up behind the wolves, but the men didn’t\\nsee them. They’re heading toward the pool. Probably they don’t have anything to do with us; it’s the\\nonly water for miles.

Is she looking at\\nyou as if she doesn’t know you anymore? Does she know you?\\n “Dapple says they smell wrong.\\nIt’s . . . sort of the way a rabid dog smells wrong.” The pool was lost to sight behind them.

It’s supposed to\\nbe safe. Light, there has to be someplace safe.”\\nPerrin began looking harder for somewhere to hide. They could not be very far from the pool,\\nbut the twilight was thickening. Soon it would be too dark to travel. Faint light still bathed the crests.\\nFrom the hollows between, where there was barely enough to see, it seemed bright by contrast. Off to\\nthe left a dark shape stood sharp against the sky, a large, flat stone slanting out of a hillside, cloaking\\nthe slope beneath in darkness.'),\n",

Perrin thought they both must be more tired than he had believed. \\nThis had better be a good\\nhiding place. I don’t think we can hunt for another.\\nAt the base of the hill he studied the massive, flat rock outlined against the sky, jutting out the\\nslope almost at the crest. There was an odd familiarity to the way the top of the huge slab seemed to\\nform irregular steps, three up and one down. He climbed the short distance and felt across the stone,\\nwalking along it. Despite the weathering of centuries he could still feel four joined columns. He\\nglanced up at the step-like top of the stone, towering over his head like a huge lean-to.

He could feel\\nEgwene’s eyes on his back.\\nAs he was helping her down from the saddle, the night broke out in shouts back toward the pool.\\nShe laid a hand on Perrin’s arm, and he heard her unspoken question.\\n“The men saw Wind,” he said reluctantly. It was difficult to pick out the meaning of the wolves’\\nthoughts. Something about fire. “They have torches.” He pressed her down at the base of the fingers\\nand crouched beside her. “They’re breaking up into parties to search. So many of them, and the\\nwolves are all hurt.” He tried to make his voice heartier. “But Dapple and the others should be able\\nto keep out of their way, even injured, and they don’t expect us. People don’t see what they don’t\\nexpect. They’ll give up soon enough and make camp.” Elyas was with the wolves, and would not\\nleave them while they were hunted. \\nSo many riders. So persistent. Why so persistent?\\nHe saw Egwene nod, but in the dark she did not realize it. “We’ll be all right, Perrin.”\\nLight,\\n he thought wonderingly, she’s \\ntrying to comfort\\n me.\\nThe shouts went on and on.

The wolves had been too hurt by the ravens to run far or fast, so they intended\\nto drive the men out of the darkness, drive them to the shelter of their fires. Men always sought the\\nsafety of fires in the end, when wolves roamed the night. Some of the mounted men led strings of\\nhorses without riders; they whinnied and reared with wide, rolling eyes when the gray shapes darted\\namong them, screaming and pulling their lead ropes from the hands of the men who held them,\\nscattering in all directions as fast as they could run. Horses with men on their backs screamed, too,\\nwhen gray shadows flashed out of the dark with hamstringing fangs, and sometimes their riders\\nscreamed as well, just before jaws tore out their throats. Elyas was out there, also, more dimly\\nsensed, stalking the night with his long knife, a two-legged wolf with one sharp steel tooth. The shouts\\nbecame curses more often than not, but the searchers refused to give up.\\nAbruptly Perrin realized that the men with torches were following a pattern. Each time some of\\nthe parties came in view, one of them, at least, was closer to the hillside where he and Egwene were\\nhiding. Elyas had said to hide, but. . . . \\nWhat if we run? Maybe we could hide in the dark, if we keep\\nmoving. Maybe. It has to be dark enough for that.\\nHe turned to Egwene, but as he did the decision was taken away from him.

He froze, holding his breath, hands tightening on his axe haft.\\nThe horsemen rode past the hill, but one of the men shouted, and the torches swung back. He\\nthought desperately, seeking for a way to go.

By the light of the torches Perrin\\ncould see the white cloaks of the Children of the Light. They held the torches high and leaned forward\\nin their saddles, peering up at the deep shadows under Artur Hawkwing’s fingers.\\n“There \\nis\\n something up there,” one of them said. His voice was too loud, as if he was afraid of\\nwhat lay outside the light of his torch. “I told you somebody could hide in that. Isn’t that a horse?”\\nEgwene laid a hand on Perrin’s arm; her eyes were big in the dark. Her silent question plain\\ndespite the shadow hiding her features. What to do? Elyas and the wolves still hunted through the\\nnight. The horses below shifted their feet nervously. \\nIf we run now, they’ll chase us down.\\nOne of the Whitecloaks stepped his horse forward and shouted up the hill. “If you can understand\\nhuman speech, come down and surrender. You’ll not be harmed if you walk in the Light. If you don’t\\nsurrender, you will all be killed. You have one minute.” The lances lowered, long steel heads bright\\nwith torchlight.\\n“Perrin,” Egwene whispered, “we can’t outrun them. If we don’t give up, they’ll kill us. Perrin?”\\nElyas and the wolves were still free. Another distant, bubbling scream marked a Whitecloak\\nwho had hunted Dapple too closely. \\nIf we run.\\n . . . Egwene was looking at him, waiting for him to tell\\nher what to do. \\nIf we run\\n. . . . He shook his head wearily and stood up like a man in a trance,\\nstumbling down the hill toward the Children of the Light. He heard Egwene sigh and follow him, her\\nfeet dragging reluctantly. \\nWhy are the Whitecloaks so persistent, as if they hate wolves with a\\npassion? Why do they smell wrong?\\n He almost thought he could smell the wrongness himself, when\\nthe wind gusted from the riders.\\n“Drop that axe,” the leader barked.\\nPerrin stumbled toward him, wrinkling his nose to get rid of the smell he thought he smelt.\\n“Drop it, bumpkin!” The leader’s lance shifted toward Perrin’s chest.'),\n",

Egwene was kneeling and watching him where he lay.\\nThey were in a square tent as big as a medium-sized room in a farmhouse, with a ground cloth for a\\nfloor. Oil lamps on tall stands, one in each corner, gave a bright light.\\n“Thank the Light, Perrin,” she breathed. “I was afraid they had killed you.”\\nInstead of answering, he stared at the gray-haired man seated in the lone chair in the tent. A dark-\\neyed, grandfatherly face looked back at him, a face at odds in his mind with the white-and-gold tabard\\nthe man wore, and the burnished armor strapped over his pure-white undercoat. It seemed a kindly\\nface, bluff and dignified, and something about it fit the elegant austerity of the tent’s furnishings. A\\ntable and a folding bed, a washstand with a plain white basin and pitcher, a single wooden chest\\ninlaid in simple geometric patterns. Where there was wood, it was polished to a soft glow, and the\\nmetal gleamed, but not too brightly, and nothing was showy. Everything in the tent had the look of\\ncraftsmanship, but only someone who had watched the work of craftsmen—like Master Luhhan, or\\nMaster Aydaer, the cabinetmaker—would see it.\\nFrowning, the man stirred two small piles of objects on the table with a blunt finger. Perrin\\nrecognized the contents of his pockets in one of those piles, and his belt knife. The silver coin\\nMoiraine had given him toppled out, and the man pushed it back thoughtfully.

That they were tied was shock enough, but they wore enough ropes to hold horses.\\nWhat do they think we are?\\nThe gray-haired man watched them, curious and thoughtful, like Master al’Vere puzzling out a\\nproblem. He held the axe as if he had forgotten it.\\nThe tent flap shifted aside, and a tall man stepped into the tent. His face was long and gaunt, with\\neyes so deeply set they seemed to look out from caves. There was no excess flesh on him, no fat at\\nall; his skin was pulled tight over the muscle and bone beneath.\\nPerrin had a glimpse of night outside, and campfires, and two white-cloaked guards at the\\nentrance of the tent, then the flap fell back into place. As soon as the newcomer was into the tent, he\\nstopped, standing as rigid as an iron rod, staring straight ahead of him at the far wall of the tent. His\\nplate-and-mail armor gleamed like silver against his snowy cloak and undercoat.\\n“My Lord Captain.” His voice was as hard as his posture, and grating, but somehow flat, without\\nexpression.\\nThe gray-haired man made a casual gesture. “Be at your ease, Child Byar.

All can ride,\\nthough. Thirty horses had to be put down. They were hamstrung!” He emphasized that in his\\nemotionless voice, as if what had happened to the horses were worse than the deaths and injuries to\\nmen. “Many of the remounts are scattered. We may find some at daybreak, my Lord Captain, but with\\nwolves to send them on their way, it will take days to gather them all. The men who were supposed to\\nbe watching them have been assigned to night guard until we reach Caemlyn.”\\n“We do not have days, Child Byar,” the gray-haired man said mildly. “We ride at dawn. Nothing\\ncan change that. We must be in Caemlyn in time, yes?”\\n“As you command, my Lord Captain.”\\nThe gray-haired man glanced at Perrin and Egwene, then away again. “And what have we to\\nshow for it, aside from these two younglings?”\\nByar drew a deep breath and hesitated. “I have had the wolf that was with this lot skinned, my\\nLord Captain. The hide should make a fine rug for my Lord Captain’s tent.”\\nHopper!\\n Not even realizing what he was doing, Perrin growled and struggled against his bonds.\\nThe ropes dug into his skin—his wrists became slippery with blood—but they did not give.\\nFor the first time Byar looked at the prisoners.

He could not get his thoughts straight enough to puzzle it out.\\n“Not all of them,” Egwene muttered. Perrin gave Byar a wary look, but the gaunt man only\\nwatched her. “Some of them have horns, like rams or goats, or hawks’ beaks, or . . .  or . . .  all sorts\\nof things.”\\nBornhald shook his head sadly. “I give you every chance, and you dig yourself deeper with\\nevery word.” He held up one finger. “You run with wolves, creatures of the Dark One.” A second\\nfinger. “You admit to being acquainted with a Warder, another creature of the Dark One. I doubt he\\nwould have told you what he did if it was only in passing.” A third finger. “You, boy, carry a Tar\\nValon mark in your pocket. Most men outside Tar Valon get rid of those as fast as they can. Unless\\nthey serve the Tar Valon witches.” A fourth. “You carry a fighting man’s weapon while you dress like\\na farmboy. A skulker, then.” The thumb rose. “You know Trollocs, and Myrddraal. This far south,\\nonly a few scholars and those who have traveled in the Borderlands believe they are anything but\\nstories. Perhaps you have been to the Borderlands? If so, tell me where? I have traveled a good deal'),\n",

Ah, well, then.” He looked at his spread hand, then\\ndropped it hard on the table. The grandfatherly expression said the grandchildren had been up to some\\nvery serious mischief indeed. “Why do you not tell me the truth of how you came to be running in the\\nnight with wolves?”\\nEgwene opened her mouth, but Perrin saw the stubborn set of her jaw and knew right away she\\nwas going to tell one of the stories they had worked out. That would not do. Not now, not here. His\\nhead ached, and he wished he had time to think it out, but there was no time. Who could tell where\\nthis Bornhald had traveled, with what lands and cities he was familiar? If he caught them in a lie,\\nthere would be no going back to the truth. Bornhald would be convinced they were Darkfriends, then.\\n“We’re from the Two Rivers,” he said quickly.\\nEgwene stared at him openly before she caught herself, but he pressed on with the truth—or a\\nversion of it. The two of them had left the Two Rivers to see Caemlyn. On the way they had heard of\\nthe ruins of a great city, but when they found Shadar Logoth, there were Trollocs there. The two of\\nthem managed to escape across the River Arinelle, but by that time they were completely lost. Then\\nthey fell in with a man who offered to guide them to Caemlyn. He had said his name was none of their\\nbusiness, and he hardly seemed friendly, but they needed a guide. The first either of them had seen of\\nwolves had been after the Children of the Light appeared. All they had been trying to do was hide so\\nthey would not get eaten by wolves or killed by the men on horses.\\n“. . .  If we’d known you were Children of the Light,” he finished, “we’d have gone to you for\\nhelp.”\\nByar snorted with disbelief. Perrin did not care overmuch; if the Lord Captain was convinced,\\nByar could not harm them. It was plain that Byar would stop breathing if Lord Captain Bornhald told\\nhim to.\\n“There is no Warder in that,” the gray-haired man said after a moment.\\nPerrin’s invention failed him; he knew he should have taken time to think it out. Egwene leaped\\ninto the breach. “We met him in Baerlon. The city was crowded with men who had come down from\\nthe mines after the winter, and we were put at the same table in an inn. We only talked to him for the\\nlength of a meal.”\\nPerrin breathed again. \\nThank you, Egwene.\\n“Give them back their belongings, Child Byar. Not the weapons, of course.” When Byar looked\\nat him in surprise, Bornhald added, “Or are you one of those who have taken to looting the\\nunenlightened, Child Byar? It is a bad business, that, yes? No man can be a thief and walk in the\\nLight.” Byar seemed to struggle with disbelief at the suggestion.\\n“Then you’re letting us go?” Egwene sounded surprised. Perrin lifted his head to stare at the\\nLord Captain.\\n“Of course not, child,” Bornhald said sadly. “You may be telling the truth about being from the\\nTwo Rivers, since you know about Baerlon, and the mines. But Shadar Logoth . . . ? That is a name\\nvery, very few know, most of them Darkfriends, and anyone who knows enough to know the name,\\nknows enough not to go there. I suggest you think of a better story on the journey to Amador. You will\\nhave time, since we must pause in Caemlyn. Preferably the truth, child. There is freedom in truth and\\nthe Light.”\\nByar forgot some of his diffidence toward the gray-haired man. He spun from the prisoners, and\\nthere was an outraged snap to his words. “You can’t! It is not allowed!” Bornhald raised one\\neyebrow quizzically, and Byar pulled himself up short, swallowing. “Forgive me, my Lord Captain. I\\nforgot myself, and I humbly beg pardon and submit myself for penance, but as my Lord Captain'),\n",

He might\\nhave been suggesting stepping on a bug. “There is no truce with the Shadow. There is no mercy for\\nDarkfriends.”\\n“Zeal is to be applauded, Child Byar, but, as I must often tell my son, Dain, overzealousness can\\nbe a grievous fault. Remember that the Tenets also say, ‘No man is so lost that he cannot be brought to\\nthe Light.’ These two are young. They cannot yet be deep in the Shadow. They can yet be led to the\\nLight, if they will only allow the Shadow to be lifted from their eyes. We must give them that chance.”\\nFor a moment Perrin almost felt affection for the grandfatherly man who stood between them and\\nByar. Then Bornhald turned his grandfather’s smile on Egwene.\\n“If you refuse to come to the Light by the time we reach Amador, I will be forced to turn you\\nover to the Questioners, and beside them Byar’s zeal is but a candle beside the sun.” The gray-haired\\nman sounded like a man who regretted what he must do, but who had no intention of ever doing\\nanything but his duty as he saw it. “Repent, renounce the Dark One, come to the Light, confess your\\nsins and tell what you know of this vileness with wolves, and you will be spared that. You will walk\\nfree, in the Light.” His gaze centered on Perrin, and he sighed sadly. Ice filled Perrin’s spine. “But\\nyou, just Perrin from the Two Rivers. You killed two of the Children.” He touched the axe that Byar\\nstill held. “For you, I fear, a gibbet waits in Amador.”\\n'),\n",

Mat was already headed toward the wild hedgerow alongside the roadway. Its evergreen\\nleaves and densely intermeshed branches would hide them as well as a stone wall, if they could find\\na way through to the other side. The other side of the road was marked by the sparse brown skeletons\\nof head-high bushes, and beyond was an open field for half a mile to the woods. It might have been\\npart of a farm not too long abandoned, but it offered no quick hiding place. He tried to judge the speed\\nof the dust-tail, and the wind.\\nA sudden gust swirled road dust up around him, obscuring everything. He blinked and adjusted\\nthe plain, dark scarf across his nose and mouth. None too clean now, it made his face itch, but it kept\\nhim from inhaling dust with every breath. A farmer had given it to him, a long-faced man with\\ngrooves in his cheeks from worry.\\n“I don’t know what you’re running from,” he had said with an anxious frown, “and I don’t want\\nto. You understand? My family.” Abruptly the farmer had dug two long scarves out of his coat pocket\\nand pushed the tangle of wool at them. “It’s not much, but here. Belong to my boys. They have others.\\nYou don’t know me, understand? It’s hard times.”\\nRand treasured the scarf. The list of kindnesses he had made in his mind in the days since\\nWhitebridge was a short one, and he did not believe it would get much longer.\\nMat, all but his eyes hidden by the scarf wrapped around his head, hunted swiftly along the tall\\nhedgerow, pulling at the leafy branches. Rand touched the heron-marked hilt at his belt, but let his\\nhand fall away. Once already, cutting a hole through a hedge had almost given them away. The dust-\\ntail was moving toward them, and staying together too long. Not the wind. At least it was not raining.\\nRain settled the dust. No matter how hard it fell, it never turned the hard-packed road to mud, but\\nwhen it rained there was no dust. Dust was the only warning they had before whoever it was came\\nclose enough to hear. Sometimes that was too late.\\n“Here,” Mat called softly. He seemed to step right through the hedge. Rand hurried to the spot.\\nSomeone had cut a hole there, once. It was partly grown over, and from three feet away it looked as\\nsolid as the rest, but close up there was only a thin screen of branches. As he pushed through, he\\nheard horses coming. Not the wind.\\nHe crouched behind the barely covered opening, clutching the hilt of his sword as the horsemen\\nrode by. Five . . .  six . . .  seven of them. Plainly dressed men, but swords and spears said they were\\nnot villagers. Some wore leather tunics with metal studs, and two had round steel caps. Merchants’\\nguards, perhaps, between hirings.

Mat snarled silently like a cornered badger, squinting above his scarf.\\nHis hand was under his coat; he always clutched the dagger from Shadar Logoth when there was\\ndanger. Rand was no longer sure if it was to protect himself or to protect the ruby-hilted dagger. Of\\nlate Mat seemed to forget he had a bow, sometimes.\\nThe riders passed at a slow trot, going somewhere with a purpose but not too great a haste. Dust\\nsifted through the hedge.\\nRand waited until the clop of the hooves faded before he stuck his head cautiously back through\\nthe hole. The dust-tail was well down the road, going the way they had come. Eastward the sky was\\nclear. He climbed out onto the roadway, watching the column of dust move west.\\n“Not after us,” he said, halfway between a statement and a question.\\nMat scrambled out after him, looking warily in both directions. “Maybe,” he said. “Maybe.”\\nRand had no idea which way he meant it, but he nodded. Maybe. It had not begun like this, their\\njourney down the Caemlyn Road.\\nFor a long time after leaving Whitebridge, Rand would suddenly find himself staring back down\\nthe road behind them. Sometimes he would see someone who made his breath catch, a tall, skinny\\nman hurrying up the road, or a lanky, white-haired fellow up beside the driver on a wagon, but it was\\nalways a pack-peddler, or farmers making their way to market, never Thom Merrilin. Hope faded as\\nthe days passed.\\nThere was considerable traffic on the road, wagons and carts, people on horses and people\\nafoot. They came singly and in groups, a train of merchants’ wagons or a dozen horsemen together.\\nThey did not jam the road, and often there was nothing in sight except the all but leafless trees lining\\nthe hard-packed roadbed, but there were certainly more people traveling than Rand had ever seen in\\nthe Two Rivers.\\nMost traveled in the same direction that they did, eastward toward Caemlyn. Sometimes they got\\na ride in a farmer’s wagon for a little distance, a mile, or five, but more often they walked. Men on\\nhorseback they avoided; when they spotted even one rider in the distance they scrambled off the road\\nand hid until he was past. None ever wore a black cloak, and Rand did not really think a Fade would\\nlet them see him coming, but there was no point in taking chances. In the beginning it was just the\\nHalfmen they feared.\\nThe first village after Whitebridge looked so much like Emond’s Field that Rand’s steps dragged\\nwhen he saw it. Thatched roofs with high peaks, and goodwives in their aprons gossiping over the\\nfences between their houses, and children playing on a village green. The women’s hair hung\\nunbraided around their shoulders, and other small things were different, too, but the whole together\\nwas like home. Cows cropped on the green, and geese waddled self-importantly across the road. The\\nchildren tumbled, laughing, in the dust where the grass was gone altogether. They did not even look\\naround when Rand and Mat went by. That was another thing that was different. Strangers were no\\noddity there; two more did not draw so much as a second glance. Village dogs only raised their heads\\nto sniff as he and Mat passed; none stirred themselves.\\nIt was coming on evening as they went through the village, and he felt a pang of homesickness as\\nlights appeared in the windows. \\nNo matter what it looks like,\\n a small voice whispered in his mind, \\nit\\nisn’t really home. Even if you go into one of those houses Tam won’t be there. If he was, could you\\nlook him in the face? You know, now, don’t you? Except for little things like where you come from\\nand who you are. No fever-dreams.\\n He hunched his shoulders against taunting laughter inside his\\nhead. \\nYou might as well stop,\\n the voice snickered. \\nOne place is as good as another when you aren’t'),\n",

He did not want to stop,\\nbut he did want to look and remember. \\nSo much like home, but you’ll never see that again, will you?\\nMat yanked at him again. His face was taut, the skin around his mouth and eyes white. “Come\\non,” Mat muttered. “Come on.” He looked at the village as if he suspected something of hiding there.\\n“Come on. We can’t stop yet.”\\nRand turned in a complete circle, taking in the whole village, and sighed. They were not very far\\nfrom Whitebridge. If the Myrddraal could get past Whitebridge’s wall without being seen, it would\\nhave no trouble at all searching this small village. He let himself be drawn on into the countryside\\nbeyond, until the thatch-roofed houses were left behind.\\nNight fell before they found a spot by moonlight, under some bushes still bearing their dead\\nleaves. They filled their bellies with cold water from a shallow rivulet not far away and curled up on\\nthe ground, wrapped in their cloaks, without a fire. A fire could be seen; better to be cold.\\nUneasy with his memories, Rand woke often, and every time he could hear Mat muttering and\\ntossing in his sleep. He did not dream, that he could remember, but he did not sleep well. \\nYou’ll\\nnever see home again.\\nThat was not the only night they spent with just their cloaks to protect them from the wind, and\\nsometimes the rain, cold and soaking. It was not the only meal they made from nothing but cold water.\\nBetween them they had enough coins for a few meals at an inn, but a bed for the night would take too\\nmuch. Things cost more outside the Two Rivers, more this side of the Arinelle than in Baerlon. What\\nmoney they had left had to be saved for an emergency.\\nOne afternoon Rand mentioned the dagger with the ruby in its hilt, while they were trudging\\ndown the road with bellies too empty to rumble, and the sun low and weak, and nothing in view for\\nthe coming night but more bushes. Dark clouds built up overhead for rain during the night. He hoped\\nthey were lucky; maybe no more than an icy drizzle.\\nHe went on a few steps before he realized that Mat had stopped. He stopped, too, wriggling his\\ntoes in his boots. At least his feet felt warm. He eased the straps across his shoulders. His blanketroll\\nand Thom’s bundled cloak were not heavy, but even a few pounds weighed heavy after miles on an\\nempty stomach. “What’s the matter, Mat?” he said.\\n“Why are you so anxious to sell it?” Mat demanded angrily. “I found it, after all. You ever think\\nI might like to keep it? For a while, anyway. If you want to sell something, sell that bloody sword!”\\nRand rubbed his hand along the heron-marked hilt. “My father gave this sword to me. It was his.\\nI wouldn’t ask you to sell something your father gave you. Blood and ashes, Mat, do you like going\\nhungry? Anyway, even if I could find somebody to buy it, how much would a sword bring? What\\nwould a farmer want with a sword? That ruby would fetch enough to take us all the way to Caemlyn\\nin a carriage. Maybe all the way to Tar Valon. And we’d eat every meal in an inn, and sleep every\\nnight in a bed. Maybe you like the idea of walking halfway across the world and sleeping on the\\nground?” He glared at Mat, and his friend glared back.\\nThey stood like that in the middle of the road until Mat suddenly gave an uncomfortable shrug,\\nand dropped his eyes to the road. “Who would I sell it to, Rand? A farmer would have to pay in\\nchickens; we couldn’t buy a carriage with chickens. And if I even showed it in any village we’ve\\nbeen through, they’d probably think we stole it. The Light knows what would happen then.”\\nAfter a minute Rand nodded reluctantly. “You’re right. I know it. I’m sorry; I didn’t mean to snap\\nat you. It’s only that I’m hungry and my feet hurt.”\\n“Mine, too.” They started down the road again, walking even more wearily than before. The'),\n",

A haystack was nearly as warm\\nas a room with a fire, at least compared to lying under the bushes, and a haystack, even one without a\\ntarp over it, kept all but the heaviest rain off, if you dug yourself in deeply enough. Sometimes Mat\\ntried his hand at stealing eggs, and once he attempted to milk a cow left unattended, staked out on a\\nlong rope to crop in a field. Most farms had dogs, though, and farm dogs were watchful. A two-mile\\nrun with baying hounds at their heels was too high a price for two or three eggs as Rand saw it,\\nespecially when the dogs sometimes took hours to go away and let them down out of the tree where\\nthey had taken shelter. The hours were what he regretted.\\nHe did not really like doing it, but Rand preferred to approach a farmhouse openly in broad\\ndaylight. Now and again they had the dogs set on them anyway, without a word being said, for the\\nrumors and the times made everyone who lived apart from other people nervous about strangers, but\\noften an hour or so chopping wood or hauling water would earn a meal and a bed, even if the bed was\\na pile of straw in the barn. But an hour or two doing chores was an hour or two of daylight when they\\nwere standing still, an hour or two for the Myrddraal to catch up. Sometimes he wondered how many\\nmiles a Fade could cover in an hour. He begrudged every minute of it—though admittedly not so much\\nwhen he was wolfing down a goodwife’s hot soup. And when they had no food, knowing they had\\nspent every possible minute moving toward Caemlyn did not do much to soothe an empty belly. Rand\\ncould not make up his mind if it was worse to lose time or go hungry, but Mat went beyond worrying\\nabout his belly or pursuit.\\n“What do we know about them, anyway?” Mat demanded one afternoon while they were\\nmucking out stalls on a small farm.\\n“Light, Mat, what do they know about us?” Rand sneezed. They were working stripped to the\\nwaist, and sweat and straw covered them both liberally, and motes of straw-dust hung in the air.\\n“What I know is they’ll give us some roast lamb and a real bed to sleep in.”\\nMat dug his hayfork into the straw and manure and gave a sidelong frown at the farmer, coming\\nfrom the back of the barn with a bucket in one hand and his milking stool in the other. A stooped old\\nman with skin like leather and thin, gray hair, the farmer slowed when he saw Mat looking at him,\\nthen looked away quickly and hurried on out of the barn, slopping milk over the rim of the bucket in\\nhis haste.\\n“He’s up to something, I tell you,” Mat said. “See the way he wouldn’t meet my eye? Why are\\nthey so friendly to a couple of wanderers they never laid eyes on before? Tell me that.”\\n“His wife says we remind her of their grandsons. Will you stop worrying about them? What we\\nhave to worry about is behind us. I hope.”\\n“He’s up to something,” Mat muttered.\\nWhen they finished, they washed up at the trough in front of the barn, their shadows stretching\\nlong with the sinking sun. Rand toweled off with his shirt as they walked to the farmhouse. The farmer\\nmet them at the door; he leaned on a quarterstaff in a too-casual manner. Behind him his wife clutched\\nher apron and peered past his shoulder, chewing her lip. Rand sighed; he did not think he and Mat\\nreminded them of their grandsons any longer.\\n“Our sons are coming to visit tonight,” the old man said. “All four of them. I forgot. They’re all\\nfour coming. Big lads. Strong. Be here any time, now. I’m afraid we don’t have the bed we promised\\nyou.”\\nHis wife thrust a small bundle wrapped in a napkin past him. “Here.

Come on, Mat.”\\nMat followed him, grumbling while he pulled his shirt over his head. Rand thought it best to\\ncover as many miles as they could before stopping to eat. The old farmer had a dog.\\nIt could have been worse, he thought. Three days earlier, while they were still working, they’d\\nhad the dogs set on them. The dogs, and the farmer, and his two sons waving cudgels chased them out\\nto the Caemlyn Road and half a mile down it before giving up. They had barely had time to snatch up\\ntheir belongings and run. The farmer had carried a bow with a broad-head arrow nocked.\\n“Don’t come back, hear!” he had shouted after them. “I don’t know what you’re up to, but don’t\\nlet me see your shifty eyes again!”\\nMat had started to turn back, fumbling at his quiver, but Rand pulled him on. “Are you crazy?”\\nMat gave him a sullen look, but at least he kept running.\\nRand sometimes wondered if it was worthwhile stopping at farms. The further they went, the\\nmore suspicious of strangers Mat became, and the less he was able to hide it. Or bothered to. The\\nmeals got skimpier for the same work, and sometimes not even the barn was offered as a place to\\nsleep. But then a solution to all their problems came to Rand, or so it seemed, and it came at\\nGrinwell’s farm.\\nMaster Grinwell and his wife had nine children, the eldest a daughter not more than a year\\nyounger than Rand and Mat. Master Grinwell was a sturdy man, and with his children he probably\\nhad no need of any more help, but he looked them up and down, taking in their travel-stained clothes\\nand dusty boots, and allowed as how he could always find work for more hands. Mistress Grinwell\\nsaid that if they were going to eat at her table, they would not do it in those filthy things. She was\\nabout to do laundry, and some of her husband’s old clothes would fit them well enough for working.\\nShe smiled when she said it, and for a minute she looked to Rand just like Mistress al’Vere, though\\nher hair was yellow; he had never seen hair that color before. Even Mat seemed to lose some of his\\ntension when her smile touched him. The eldest daughter was another matter.\\nDark-haired, big-eyed, and pretty, Else grinned impudently at them whenever her parents were\\nnot looking. While they worked, moving barrels and sacks of grain in the barn, she hung over a stall\\ndoor, humming to herself and chewing the end of one long pigtail, watching them. Rand she watched\\nespecially. He tried to ignore her, but after a few minutes he put on the shirt Master Grinwell had\\nloaned him. It was tight across the shoulders and too short, but it was better than nothing. Else laughed\\nout loud when he tugged it on. He began to think that this time it would not be Mat’s fault when they\\nwere chased off.\\nPerrin would know how to handle this,\\n he thought. \\nHe’d make some offhand comment, and\\npretty soon she’d be laughing at his jokes instead of mooning around where her father can see.\\nOnly he could not think of any offhand comment, or any jokes, either. Whenever he looked in her\\ndirection, she smiled at him in a way that would have her father loosing the dogs on them if he saw.\\nOnce she told him she liked tall men. All the boys on the farms around there were short. Mat gave a\\nnasty snicker. Wishing he could think of a joke, Rand tried to concentrate on his hayfork.\\nThe younger children, at least, were a blessing in Rand’s eyes. Mat’s wariness always eased a\\nlittle when there were children around. After supper they all settled in front of the fireplace, with\\nMaster Grinwell in his favorite chair thumbing his pipe full of tabac and Mistress Grinwell fussing\\nwith her sewing box and the shirts she had washed for him and Mat. Mat dug out Thom’s colored\\nballs and began to juggle. He never did that unless there were children. The children laughed when he\\npretended to be dropping the balls, snatching them at the last minute, and they clapped for fountains'),\n",

But they took it in good part,\\nMaster Grinwell and his wife applauding as hard as their children. When Mat was done, bowing\\naround the room with as many flourishes as Thom might have made, Rand took Thom’s flute from its\\ncase.\\nHe could never handle the instrument without a pang of sadness. Touching its gold-and-silver\\nscrollwork was like touching Thom’s memory. He never handled the harp except to see that it was\\nsafe and dry—Thom had always said the harp was beyond a farmboy’s clumsy hands—but whenever\\na farmer allowed them to stay, he always played one tune on the flute after supper. It was just a little\\nsomething extra to pay the farmer, and maybe a way of keeping Thom’s memory fresh.\\nWith a laughing mood already set by Mat’s juggling, he played “Three Girls in the Meadow.”\\nMaster and Mistress Grinwell clapped along, and the smaller children danced around the floor, even\\nthe smallest boy, who could barely walk, stomping his feet in time.

If she accused him of trifling with her daughter. . . . In desperation he put the\\nflute back to his lips and played another song, then another, and another. Mistress Grinwell kept\\nwatching him. He played “The Wind That Shakes the Willow,” and “Coming Home From Tarwin’s\\nGap,” and “Mistress Aynora’s Rooster,” and “The Old Black Bear.” He played every song he could\\nthink of, but she never took her eyes off him. She never said anything, either, but she watched, and\\nweighed.\\nIt was late when Master Grinwell finally stood up, chuckling and rubbing his hands together.\\n“Well, this has been rare fun, but it’s way past our bedtime. You traveling lads make your own hours,\\nbut morning comes early on a farm. I’ll tell you lads, I have paid good money at an inn for no better\\nentertainment than I’ve had this night. For worse.”\\n“I think they should have a reward, father,” Mistress Grinwell said as she picked up her\\nyoungest boy, who had long since fallen asleep in front of the fire. “The barn is no fit place to sleep.\\nThey can sleep in Else’s room tonight, and she will sleep with me.”\\nElse grimaced. She was careful to keep her head down, but Rand saw it. He thought her mother\\ndid, too.\\nMaster Grinwell nodded. “Yes, yes, much better than the barn. If you don’t mind sleeping two to\\na bed, that is.” Rand flushed; Mistress Grinwell was still looking at him. “I do wish I could hear\\nmore of that flute. And your juggling, too. I like that.

By the time they did reach the next village, it was something else again.\\nWith dusk descending, they entered the only inn in Arien, and Rand spoke to the innkeeper. He\\nplayed “Ferry O’er the River”—which the plump innkeeper called “Darling Sara”—and part of “The\\nRoad to Dun Aren,” and Mat did a little juggling, and the upshot was that they slept in a bed that night\\nand ate roasted potatoes and hot beef. It was the smallest room in the inn, to be sure, up under the\\neaves in the back, and the meal came in the middle of a long night of playing and juggling, but it was\\nstill a bed beneath a roof. Even better, to Rand, every daylight hour had been spent traveling. And the\\ninn’s patrons did not seem to care if Mat stared at them suspiciously. Some of them even looked\\naskance at one another. The times made suspicion of strangers a commonplace, and there were\\nalways strangers at an inn.\\nRand slept better than he had since leaving Whitebridge, despite sharing a bed with Mat and his\\nnocturnal muttering. In the morning the innkeeper tried to talk them into staying another day or two, but\\nwhen he could not, he called over a bleary-eyed farmer who had drunk too much to drive his cart\\nhome the night before. An hour later they were five miles further east, sprawling on their backs on the\\nstraw in the back of Eazil Forney’s cart.\\nThat became the way of their traveling. With a little luck, and maybe a ride or two, they could\\nalmost always reach the next village by dark. If there was more than one inn in a village, the\\ninnkeepers would bid for them once they heard Rand’s flute and saw Mat juggle. Together they still\\ndid not come close to a gleeman, but they were more than most villages saw in a year. Two or three\\ninns in a town meant a better room, with two beds, and more generous portions of a better cut of meat,\\nand sometimes even a few coppers in their pockets when they left besides. In the mornings there was\\nalmost always someone to offer a ride, another farmer who had stayed too late and drunk too much, or\\na merchant who had liked their entertainment enough not to mind if they hopped up on the back of one\\nof his wagons.

As\\nusual, the Caemlyn Road ran straight through the center of the town, but another heavily traveled\\nhighway came in from the south, too. Most villages were markets and gathering places for the farmers\\nof the area, but there were few farmers to be seen here. Four Kings survived as a stopover for\\nmerchants’ wagon trains on their way to Caemlyn and to the mining towns in the Mountains of Mist\\nbeyond Baerlon, as well as the villages between. The southern road carried Lugard’s trade with the\\nmines in the west; Lugarder merchants going to Caemlyn had a more direct route. The surrounding\\ncountry held few farms, barely enough to feed themselves and the town, and everything in the village\\ncentered on the merchants and their wagons, the men who drove them and the laborers who loaded the\\ngoods.\\nPlots of bare earth, ground to dust, lay scattered through Four Kings, filled with wagons parked\\nwheel to wheel and abandoned except for a few bored guards. Stables and horse-lots lined the\\nstreets, all of which were wide enough to allow wagons to pass and deeply rutted from too many\\nwheels. There was no village green, and the children played in the ruts, dodging wagons and the\\ncurses of wagon drivers. Village women, their heads covered with scarves, kept their eyes down and\\nwalked quickly, sometimes followed by wagoneers’ comments that made Rand blush; even Mat gave\\na start at some of them. No woman stood gossiping over the fence with a neighbor. Drab wooden\\nhouses stood cheek by jowl, with only narrow alleys between and whitewash—where anyone had\\nbothered to whitewash the weathered boards—faded as if it had not been freshened in years. Heavy\\nshutters on the houses had not been open in so long that the hinges were solid lumps of rust. Noise\\nhung over everything, clanging from blacksmiths, shouts from the wagon drivers, raucous laughter\\nfrom the town’s inns.\\nRand swung down from the back of a merchant’s canvas-topped wagon as they came abreast of a\\ngarishly painted inn, all greens and yellows that caught the eye from afar among the leaden houses.\\nThe line of wagons kept moving. None of the drivers even seemed to notice that he and Mat had gone;\\ndusk was falling, and they all had their eyes on unhitching the horses and reaching the inns. Rand\\nstumbled in a rut, then leaped quickly to avoid a heavy-laden wagon clattering the other way. The\\ndriver shouted a curse at him as the wagon rolled by. A village woman stepped around him and\\nhurried on without ever meeting his eye.\\n“I don’t know about this place,” he said. He thought he could hear music mixed in the din, but he\\ncould not tell from where it was coming. From the inn, maybe, but it was hard to be sure. “I don’t like\\nit. Maybe we’d better go on this time.”'),\n",

Dark clouds thickened overhead.\\n“And sleep under a hedge tonight? In that? I’m used to a bed again.” He cocked his head to listen, then\\ngrunted. “Maybe one of these places doesn’t have musicians. Anyway, I’ll bet they don’t have a\\njuggler.” He slung his bow across his shoulders and started for the bright yellow door, studying\\neverything through narrowed eyes. Rand followed doubtfully.\\nThere were musicians inside, their zither and drum almost drowned in coarse laughter and\\ndrunken shouting. Rand did not bother to find the landlord. The next two inns had musicians as well,\\nand the same deafening cacophony. Roughly dressed men filled the tables and stumbled across the\\nfloor, waving mugs and trying to fondle serving maids who dodged with fixed, long-suffering smiles.\\nThe buildings shook with the racket, and the smell was sour, a stench of old wine and unwashed\\nbodies. Of the merchants, in their silk and velvet and lace, there was no sign; private dining rooms\\nabovestairs protected their ears and noses. He and Mat only put their heads in the doors before\\nleaving. He was beginning to think they would have no choice but to move on.\\nThe fourth inn, The Dancing Cartman, stood silent.\\nIt was as gaudy as the other inns, yellow trimmed in bright red and bilious, eye-wrenching green,\\nthough here the paint was cracked and peeling. Rand and Mat stepped inside.\\nOnly half a dozen men sat at the tables that filled the common room, hunched over their mugs,\\neach one glumly alone with his thoughts. Business was definitely not good, but it had been better\\nonce. Exactly as many serving maids as there were patrons busied themselves around the room. There\\nwas plenty for them to do—dirt crusted the floor and cobwebs filled the corners of the ceiling—but\\nmost were not doing anything really useful, only moving so they would not be seen standing still.\\nA bony man with long, stringy hair to his shoulders turned to scowl at them as they came through\\nthe door. The first slow peal of thunder rumbled across Four Kings. “What do you want?” He was\\nrubbing his hands on a greasy apron that hung to his ankles. Rand wondered if more grime was\\ncoming off on the apron or on the man’s hands. He was the first skinny innkeeper Rand had seen.\\n“Well? Speak up, buy a drink, or get out! Do I look like a raree show?”\\nFlushing, Rand launched into the spiel he had perfected at inns before this. “I play the flute, and\\nmy friend juggles, and you’ll not see two better in a year. For a good room and a good meal, we’ll fill\\nthis common room of yours.” He remembered the filled common rooms he had already seen that\\nevening, especially the man who had vomited right in front of him at the last one. He had had to step\\nlively to keep his boots untouched. He faltered, but caught himself and went on. “We’ll fill your inn\\nwith men who will repay the little we cost twenty times over with the food and drink they buy. Why\\nshould—”\\n“I’ve got a man plays the dulcimer,” the innkeeper said sourly.\\n“You have a drunk, Saml Hake,” one of the serving maids said. She was passing him with a tray\\nand two mugs, and she paused to give Rand and Mat a plump smile. “Most times, he can’t see well\\nenough to find the common room,” she confided in a loud whisper. “Haven’t even seen him in two\\ndays.”\\nWithout taking his eyes off Rand and Mat, Hake casually backhanded her across the face. She\\ngave a surprised grunt and fell heavily to the unwashed floor; one of the mugs broke, and the spilled\\nwine washed rivulets in the dirt. “You’re docked for the wine and breakage. Get ’em fresh drinks.\\nAnd hurry. Men don’t pay to wait while you laze around.” His tone was as offhand as the blow. None\\nof the patrons looked up from their wine, and the other serving maids kept their eyes averted.\\nThe plump woman rubbed her cheek and stared pure murder at Hake, but she gathered the empty\\nmug and the broken pieces on her tray and went off without a word.'),\n",

His gaze clung to the heron-mark\\nsword before he pulled it away. “Tell you what,” he said finally. “You can have a couple of pallets in\\nan empty storeroom in the back. Rooms are too expensive to give away. You eat when everybody’s\\ngone. There ought to be something left.”\\nRand wished there was an inn in Four Kings they had not yet tried. Since leaving Whitebridge he\\nhad met coolness, indifference, and outright hostility, but nothing that gave him the sense of unease\\nthat this man and this village did. He told himself it was just the dirt and squalor and noise, but the\\nmisgivings did not go away. Mat was watching Hake as if he suspected some trap, but he gave no sign\\nof wanting to give up The Dancing Cartman for a bed under a hedge. Thunder rattled the windows.\\nRand sighed.\\n“The pallets will do if they’re clean, and if there are enough clean blankets. But we eat two\\nhours after full dark, no later, and the best you have. Here. We’ll show you what we can do.” He\\nreached for the flute case, but Hake shook his head.\\n“Don’t matter. This lot’ll be satisfied with any kind of screeching so long as it sounds something\\nlike music.” His eyes touched Rand’s sword again; his thin smile touched nothing but his lips. “Eat\\nwhen you want, but if you don’t bring the crowd in, out you go in the street.” He nodded over his\\nshoulder at two hard-faced men sitting against the wall. They were not drinking, and their arms were\\nthick enough for legs. When Hake nodded at them, their eyes shifted to Rand and Mat, flat and\\nexpressionless.\\nRand put one hand on his sword hilt, hoping the twisting in his stomach did not show on his face.\\n“As long as we get what’s agreed on,” he said in a level tone.\\nHake blinked, and for a moment he seemed uneasy himself. Abruptly he nodded. “What I said,\\nisn’t it? Well, get started. You won’t bring anybody in just standing there.” He stalked off, scowling\\nand shouting at the serving maids as if there were fifty customers they were neglecting.\\nThere was a small, raised platform at the far end of the room, near the door to the back. Rand\\nlifted a bench up on it, and settled his cloak, blanketroll, and Thom’s bundled cloak behind the bench\\nwith the sword lying atop them.\\nHe wondered if he had been wise to keep wearing the sword openly. Swords were common\\nenough, but the heron-mark attracted attention and speculation. Not from everybody, but any notice at\\nall made him uncomfortable. He could be leaving a clear trail for the Myrddraal—if Fades needed\\nthat kind of trail. They did not seem to. In any case, he was reluctant to stop wearing it. Tam had\\ngiven it to him. His father. As long as he wore the sword, there was still some connection between\\nTam and him, a thread that gave him the right to still call Tam father. \\nToo late now,\\n he thought. He\\nwas not sure what he meant, but he was sure it was true. \\nToo late.\\nAt the first note of “Cock o’ the North” the half-dozen patrons in the common room lifted their\\nheads out of their wine. Even the two bouncers sat forward a little. They all applauded when he\\nfinished, including the two toughs, and once more when Mat sent a shower of colored balls spinning\\nthrough his hands. Outside, the sky muttered again. The rain was holding off, but the pressure of it was\\npalpable; the longer it waited, the harder it would fall.\\nWord spread, and by the time it was dark outside the inn was packed full with men laughing and\\ntalking so loud that Rand could barely hear what he was playing. Only the thunder overpowered the\\nnoise in the common room. Lightning flashed in the windows, and in the momentary lulls he could\\nfaintly hear rain drumming on the roof. Men who came in now dripped trails across the floor.\\nWhenever he paused, voices shouted the names of tunes through the din. A good many names he\\ndid not recognize, though when he got someone to hum a bit of it, he often found he did know the song.'),\n",

Some names stayed the same; others changed with ten miles’\\ndistance, and he had learned new songs, too. “The Drunken Peddler” was a new one, though\\nsometimes it was called “Tinker in the Kitchen.” “Two Kings Came Hunting” was “Two Horses\\nRunning” and several other names besides. He played the ones he knew, and men pounded the tables\\nfor more.\\nOthers called for Mat to juggle again. Sometimes fights broke out between those wanting music\\nand those who fancied juggling. Once a knife flashed, and a woman screamed, and a man reeled back\\nfrom a table with blood streaming down his face, but Jak and Strom, the two bouncers, closed in\\nswiftly and with complete impartiality threw everyone involved into the street with lumps on their\\nheads. That was their tactic with any trouble. The talk and the laughing went on as if nothing had\\noccurred. Nobody even looked around except those the bouncers jostled on their way to the door.\\nThe patrons were free with their hands, too, when one of the serving maids let herself grow\\nunwary. More than once Jak or Strom had to rescue one of the women, though they were none too\\nquick about it. The way Hake carried on, screaming and shaking the woman involved, he always\\nconsidered it her fault, and the teary eyes and stammered apologies said she was willing to accept his\\nopinion.

After a while Rand realized Hake was not\\nsmiling at them; the smiles came when his eyes slid behind them, to where the heron-mark sword lay.\\nOnce, when Rand set the gold-and-silver-chased flute down beside his stool, the flute got a smile,\\ntoo.\\nThe next time he changed places with Mat at the front of the dais, he leaned over to speak in\\nMat’s ear. Even that close he had to speak loudly, but with all the noise he doubted if anyone else\\ncould hear. “Hake’s going to try to rob us.”\\nMat nodded as if it was nothing he had not expected. “We’ll have to bar our door tonight.”\\n“Bar our door? Jak and Strom could break down a door with their fists. Let’s get out of here.”\\n“Wait till after we eat, at least. I’m hungry. They can’t do anything here,” Mat added. The\\npacked common room shouted impatiently for them to get on with it. Hake was glaring at them.\\n“Anyway, you want to sleep outside tonight?” An especially strong crack of lightning drowned out\\neverything else, and for an instant the light through the windows was stronger than the lamps.\\n“I just want to get out without my head being broken,” Rand said, but Mat was already slouching\\nback to take his rest on the stool. Rand sighed and launched into “The Road to Dun Aren.” A lot of\\nthem seemed to like that one; he had already played it four times, and they still shouted for it.\\nThe trouble was that Mat was right, as far as he went. He was hungry, too. And he could not see\\nhow Hake could give them any trouble while the common room was full, and getting fuller. For every\\nman who left or was thrown out by Jak and Strom, two came in from the street. They shouted for the\\njuggling or for a particular tune, but mostly they were interested in drinking and fondling the serving\\nmaids. One man was different, though.\\nHe stood out in every way among the crowd in The Dancing Cartman. Merchants apparently had\\nno use for the run-down inn; there were not even any private dining rooms for them, as far as he could\\nmake out. The patrons were all rough-dressed, with the tough skin of men who labored in the sun and\\nwind. This man was sleekly fleshy, with a soft look to his hands, and a velvet coat, and a dark green\\nvelvet cloak lined with blue silk was slung around his shoulders. All of his clothes had an expensive\\ncut to them. His shoes—soft velvet slippers, not boots—were not made for the rutted streets of Four'),\n",

He scanned the room once, already turning to go, then suddenly gave a start at nothing\\nRand could see and sat down at a table Jak and Strom had just emptied. A serving maid stopped at his\\ntable, then brought him a mug of wine which he pushed to one side and never touched again. She\\nseemed in a hurry to leave his table both times, though he did not try to touch her or even look at her.\\nWhatever it was about him that made her uneasy, others who came close to him noticed it, too. For all\\nof his soft look, whenever some callus-handed wagon driver decided to share his table, one glance\\nwas all it took to send the man looking elsewhere. He sat as if there were no one else in the room but\\nhim—and Rand and Mat. Them he watched over steepled hands that glittered with a ring on each\\nfinger. He watched them with a smile of satisfied recognition.\\nRand murmured to Mat as they were changing places again, and Mat nodded. “I saw him,” he\\nmuttered. “Who \\nis\\n he? I keep thinking I know him.”\\nThe same thought had occurred to Rand, tickling the back of his memory, but he could not bring it\\nforward. Yet he was sure that face was one he had never seen before.\\nWhen they had been performing for two hours, as near as Rand could estimate, he slipped the\\nflute into its case and he and Mat gathered up their belongings. As they were stepping down from the\\nlow platform, Hake came bustling up, anger twisting his narrow face.\\n“It’s time to eat,” Rand said to forestall him, “and we don’t want our things stolen. You want to\\ntell the cook?” Hake hesitated, still angry, trying unsuccessfully to keep his eyes off what Rand held\\nin his arms. Casually Rand shifted his bundles so he could rest one hand on the sword. “Or you can\\ntry\\n throwing us out.” He made the emphasis deliberately, then added, “There’s a lot of night left for\\nus to play, yet. We have to keep our strength up if we’re going to perform well enough to keep this\\ncrowd spending money. How long do you think this room will stay full if we fall over from hunger?”\\nHake’s eyes twitched over the room full of men putting money in his pocket, then he turned and\\nstuck his head through the door to the rear of the inn. “Feed ’em!” he shouted. Rounding on Rand and\\nMat, he snarled, “Don’t be all night about it. I expect you up there till the last man’s gone.”\\nSome of the patrons were shouting for the musician and the juggler, and Hake turned to soothe\\nthem. The man in the velvet cloak was one of the anxious ones. Rand motioned Mat to follow him.\\nA stout door separated the kitchen from the front of the inn, and, except when it opened to let a\\nserving maid through, the rain pounding the roof was louder in the kitchen than the shouts from the\\ncommon room. It was a big room, hot and steamy from stoves and ovens, with a huge table covered\\nwith half-prepared food and dishes ready to be served. Some of the serving maids sat clustered on a\\nbench near the rear door, rubbing their feet and chattering away all at once with the fat cook, who\\ntalked back at the same time and waved a big spoon to emphasize her points. They all glanced up as\\nRand and Mat came in, but it did not slow their conversation or stop their foot rubbing.\\n“We ought to get out of here while we have the chance,” Rand said softly, but Mat shook his\\nhead, his eyes fixed oh the two plates the cook was filling with beef and potatoes and peas. She\\nhardly looked at the two of them, keeping up her talk with the other women while she pushed things\\naside on the table with her elbows and set the plates down, adding forks.\\n“After we eat is time enough.” Mat slid onto a bench and began using his fork as if it were a\\nshovel.\\nRand sighed, but he was right behind Mat. He had had only a butt-end of bread to eat since the\\nnight before. His belly felt as empty as a beggar’s purse, and the cooking smells that filled the kitchen\\ndid not help.

The horses had been\\ntaken into the stable, but the two black-lacquered carriages glistened wetly outside. Thunder\\ngrumbled, and a bolt of lightning streaked above the inn. In the brief burst of light he made out a name\\nin gold script on the coach doors. Howal Gode.\\nUnmindful of the rain beating at him, he stood staring at the name he could no longer see. He\\nremembered where he had last seen black-lacquered coaches with their owners’ names on the door,\\nand sleek, overfed men in silk-lined velvet cloaks and velvet slippers. Whitebridge. A Whitebridge\\nmerchant could have a perfectly legitimate reason to be on his way to Caemlyn. \\nA reason that sends\\nhim to half the inns in town before he chooses the one where you are? A reason that makes him\\nlook at you as if he’s found what he’s searching for?\\nRand shivered, and suddenly he was aware of rain trickling down his back. His cloak was\\ntightly woven, but it had never been meant to stand up to this kind of downpour. He hurried back to\\nthe inn, splashing through deepening puddles. Jak blocked the door as he started through.\\n“Well, well, well. Out here alone in the dark. Dark’s dangerous, boy.”\\nRain slicked Rand’s hair down across his forehead. The stableyard was empty except for them.\\nHe wondered if Hake had decided he wanted the sword and the flute badly enough to forgo keeping\\nthe crowd in the common room.\\nBrushing water out of his eyes with one hand, he put the other on his sword. Even wet, the nobby\\nleather made a sure grip for his fingers. “Has Hake decided all those men will stay just for his ale,\\ninstead of going where there’s entertainment, too? If he has, we’ll call the meal even for what we’ve\\ndone so far and be on our way.”\\nDry in the doorway, the big man looked out at the rain and snorted. “In this?” His eyes slid down'),\n",

Mat was done with his second plate and working on a third, eating more slowly now, but\\nintently, as if he planned to finish every bite if it killed him. Jak took up a place by the door to the\\nstableyard, leaning against the wall and watching them. Even the cook seemed to feel no urge to talk\\nwith him there.\\n“He’s from Whitebridge,” Rand said softly. There was no need to say who “he” was. Mat’s\\nhead swiveled toward him, a piece of beef on the end of the fork suspended halfway to his mouth.\\nConscious of Jak watching, Rand stirred the food on his plate. He could not have gotten a mouthful\\ndown if he had been starving, but he tried to pretend an interest in the peas as he told Mat about the\\ncarriages, and what the women had said, in case Mat had not been listening.\\nObviously he had not been. Mat blinked in surprise and whistled between his teeth, then frowned\\nat the meat on his fork and grunted as he tossed the fork onto his plate.

I don’t know.” Rand glanced at Jak and the big man stretched elaborately, shrugging\\nshoulders as big as any blacksmith’s. “Do you think we can get past him?”\\n“Not without him making enough noise to bring Hake and the other one. I knew we should never\\nhave stopped here.”\\nRand gaped, but before he could say anything Hake pushed through the door from the common\\nroom. Strom bulked large over his shoulder. Jak stepped in front of the back door. “You going to eat\\nall night?” Hake barked. “I didn’t feed you so you could lie around out here.”\\nRand looked at his friend. Later, Mat mouthed, and they gathered their things under the watchful\\neyes of Hake, Strom, and Jak.\\nIn the common room, cries for juggling and the names of tunes burst through the clamor as soon\\nas Rand and Mat appeared.

There was no way he could avoid noticing. But it did not disturb his\\naplomb in the least.

He tried to avoid looking at the man, but he knew it was too late for that. \\nToo late.\\nToo late again.\\nOnly one thing seemed to shake the velvet-cloaked man’s equilibrium. Rand’s sword.

His pale hands clenched,\\nand he frowned at the sword for a long time before his smile came back. When it did, it was not as\\nsure as before.\\nOne good thing, at least,\\n Rand thought. \\nIf he believes I can live up to the heron-mark, maybe\\nhe’ll leave us alone. Then all we have to worry about is Hake and his bullies.\\n It was hardly a\\ncomforting thought, and, sword or no sword, Gode kept watching. And smiling.\\nTo Rand the night seemed to last a year. All those eyes looking at him: Hake and Jak and Strom\\nlike vultures watching a sheep caught in a bog, Gode waiting like something even worse. He began to\\nthink that everybody in the room was watching with some hidden motive. Sour wine fumes and the\\nstench of dirty, sweating bodies made his head swim, and the din of voices beat at him till his eyes\\nblurred and even the sound of his own flute scratched at his ears. The crash of the thunder seemed to\\nbe inside his skull. Weariness hung on him like an iron weight.\\nEventually the need to be up with the dawn began to pull men reluctantly out into the dark. A\\nfarmer had only himself to answer to, but merchants were notoriously unfeeling about hangovers when\\nthey were paying drivers’ wages. In the small hours the common room slowly emptied as even those\\nwho had rooms abovestairs staggered off to find their beds.\\nGode was the last patron. When Rand reached for the leather flute case, yawning, Gode stood up\\nand slung his cloak over his arm. The serving maids were cleaning up, muttering among themselves\\nabout the mess of spilled wine and broken crockery. Hake was locking the front door with a big key.\\nGode cornered Hake for a moment, and Hake called one of the women to show him to a room. The\\nvelvet-cloaked man gave Mat and Rand a knowing smile before he disappeared upstairs.\\nHake was looking at Rand and Mat. Jak and Strom stood at his shoulders.\\nRand hastily finished hanging his things from his shoulders, holding them all awkwardly behind\\nhim with his left hand so he could reach his sword. He made no move toward it, but he wanted to\\nknow it was ready. He suppressed a yawn; how tired he was was something they should not know.\\nMat shouldered his bow and his few other belongings awkwardly, but he put his hand under his\\ncoat as he watched Hake and his toughs approach.\\nHake was carrying an oil lamp, and to Rand’s surprise he gave a little bow and gestured to a\\nside door with it. “Your pallets are this way.” Only a slight twist of his lips spoiled his act.\\nMat thrust his chin out at Jak and Strom. “You need those two to show us our beds?”\\n“I’m a man of property,” Hake said, smoothing the front of his soiled apron, “and men of\\nproperty can’t be too careful.” A crash of thunder rattled the windows, and he glanced significantly at\\nthe ceiling, then gave them a toothy grin. “You want to see your beds or not?”\\nRand wondered what would happen if he said they wanted to leave. \\nIf you really did know more'),\n",

Taking a deep breath, Rand gave a wishful glance at the door to the kitchen.\\nIf Hake had already locked the back door, running now would only begin what he was hoping to\\navoid. He followed the innkeeper glumly.\\nAt the side door he hesitated, and Mat crowded into his back. The reason for Hake’s lamp was\\napparent. The door let into a hall as black as pitch. Only the lamp Hake carried, silhouetting Jak and\\nStrom, gave him the courage to keep on. If they turned, he would know it. \\nAnd do what?\\n The floor\\ncreaked under his boots.\\nThe hall ended in a rough, unpainted door. He had not seen if there were any other doors along\\nthe way. Hake and his bullies went through, and he followed quickly, before they could have a chance\\nto set a trap, but Hake merely lifted the lamp high and gestured at the room.\\n“Here it is.”\\nAn old storeroom, he had called it, and by the look of it not used in some time. Weathered\\nbarrels and broken crates filled half the floor. Steady drips fell from more than one place on the\\nceiling, and a broken pane in the filthy window let the rain blow in freely. Unidentifiable odds and\\nends littered the shelves, and thick dust covered almost everything. The presence of the promised\\npallets was a surprise.\\nThe sword makes him nervous. He won’t try anything until we’re sound asleep.\\n Rand had no\\nintention of sleeping under Hake’s roof. As soon as the innkeeper left, he intended to be out the\\nwindow. “It’ll do,” he said. He kept his eyes on Hake, wary for a signal to the two grinning men at the\\ninnkeeper’s side. It was an effort not to wet his lips. “Leave the lamp.”\\nHake grunted, but pushed the lamp onto a shelf. He hesitated, looking at them, and Rand was sure\\nhe was about to give the word for Jak and Strom to jump them, but his eyes went to Rand’s sword\\nwith a calculating frown, and he jerked his head at the two big men. Surprise flashed across their\\nbroad faces, but they followed him out of the room without a backward glance.\\nRand waited for the \\ncreak-creak-creak\\n of their footsteps to fade away, then counted to fifty\\nbefore sticking his head into the hall. The blackness was broken only by a rectangle of light that\\nseemed as distant as the moon: the door to the common room. As he pulled his head in, something big\\nmoved in the darkness near the far door. Jak or Strom, standing guard.\\nA quick examination of the door told him all he needed to know, little of it good. The boards\\nwere thick and stout, but there was no lock, and no bar on the inside. It did open into the room,\\nthough.\\n“I thought they were going for us,” Mat said. “What are they waiting for?” He had the dagger out,\\ngripped in a white-knuckled fist. Lamplight flickered on the blade. His bow and quiver lay forgotten\\non the floor.\\n“For us to go to sleep.” Rand started rummaging through the barrels and crates. “Help me find\\nsomething to block the door.”\\n“Why? You don’t really intend to sleep here, do you? Let’s get out the window and gone. I’d\\nrather be wet than dead.”\\n“One of them is at the end of the hall. We make any noise, and they’ll be down on us before we\\ncan blink. I think Hake would rather face us awake than risk letting us get away.”\\nMuttering, Mat joined his search, but there was nothing useful in any of the litter on the floor.\\nThe barrels were empty, the crates splintered, and the whole lot of them piled in front of the door'),\n",

Then something familiar on a shelf caught Rand’s eye. Two\\nsplitting wedges, covered with rust and dust. He took them down with a grin.\\nHastily he shoved them under the door and, when the next roll of thunder rattled the inn, drove\\nthem in with two quick kicks of his heel. The thunder faded, and he held his breath, listening. All he\\nheard was the rain pounding on the roof. No floorboards creaking under running feet.\\n“The window,” he said.\\nIt had not been opened in years, from the dirt crusted around it. They strained together, pushing\\nup with all their might. Rand’s knees wobbled before the sash budged; it groaned with each reluctant\\ninch. When the opening was wide enough for them to slip through, he crouched, then stopped.\\n“Blood and ashes!” Mat growled. “No wonder Hake wasn’t worried about us slipping out.”\\nIron bars in an iron frame glistened wetly in the light from the lamp. Rand pushed at them; they\\nwere as solid as a boulder.\\n“I saw something,” Mat said. He pawed hurriedly through the litter on the shelves and came back\\nwith a rusty crowbar. He rammed the end of it under the iron frame on one side, and Rand winced.\\n“Remember the noise, Mat.”\\nMat grimaced and muttered under his breath, but he waited. Rand put his hands on the crowbar\\nand tried to find good footing in the growing puddle of water under the window. Thunder rolled and\\nthey heaved. With a tortured squeal of nails that made the hairs lift on Rand’s neck, the frame shifted\\n—a quarter of an inch, if that. Timing themselves to peals of thunder and lightning cracks, they heaved\\non the crowbar again and again. Nothing. A quarter of an inch. Nothing. A hairsbreadth. Nothing.\\nNothing.\\nSuddenly Rand’s feet slipped in the water, and they crashed to the floor. The crowbar clattered\\nagainst the bars like a gong. He lay in a puddle holding his breath and listening. Silence but for the\\nrain.\\nMat nursed bruised knuckles and glared at him. “We’ll never get out at this rate.” The iron frame\\nwas pushed out from the window not quite far enough to get two fingers under it. Dozens of thick nails\\ncrossed the narrow opening.\\n“We just have to keep trying,” Rand said, getting up. But as he set the crowbar under the edge of\\nthe frame, the door creaked as someone tried to open it. The splitting wedges held it shut. He\\nexchanged a worried look with Mat. Mat pulled the dagger out again. The door gave another screak.\\nRand took a deep breath and tried to make his voice steady. “Go away, Hake. We’re trying to\\nsleep.”\\n“I fear you mistake me.” The voice was so sleek and full of itself that it named its owner. Howal\\nGode. “Master Hake and his . . .  minions will not trouble us. They sleep soundly, and in the morning\\nthey will only be able to wonder where you vanished to. Let me in, my young friends. We must talk.”\\n“We don’t have anything to talk to you about,” Mat said. “Go away and let us sleep.”\\nGode’s chuckle was nasty. “Of course we have things to talk about. You know that as well as I. I\\nsaw it in your eyes. I know what you are, perhaps better than you do. I can feel it coming from you in\\nwaves. Already you halfway belong to my master. Stop running and accept it. Things will be so much\\neasier for you. If the Tar Valon hags find you, you’ll wish you could cut your own throat before they\\nare done, but you won’t be able to. Only my master can protect you from them.”\\nRand swallowed hard. “We don’t know what you’re talking about. Leave us alone.” The\\nfloorboards in the hall squeaked. Gode was not alone. How many men could he have brought in two\\ncarriages?\\n“Stop being foolish, my young friends. You know. You know very well. The Great Lord of the'),\n",

The brief\\nflash of light showed men outside, men ignoring the rain that drenched them as they stood watching the\\nwindow.\\n“I tire of this,” Gode announced. “You will submit to my master—to your master—or you will\\nbe made to submit.

Sometimes the wedges held; sometimes\\nthey slid another tiny bit, and bit by tiny bit the door crept inexorably inward.\\n“Submit,” Gode demanded from the hall, “or spend eternity wishing that you had!”\\n“If we don’t have any choice—” Mat licked his lips under Rand’s stare.

Rand felt himself picked up and\\ndashed against the wall. He slid down in a heap, ears ringing and every hair on his body trying to\\nstand on end. Dazed, he staggered to his feet. His knees wobbled, and he put a hand against the wall\\nto steady himself. He looked around in amazement.\\nThe lamp, lying on its side on the edge of one of the few shelves still clinging to the walls, still\\nburned and gave light. All the barrels and crates, some blackened and smoldering, lay toppled where\\nthey had been hurled. The window, bars and all, and most of the wall, too, had vanished, leaving a\\nsplintered hole. The roof sagged, and tendrils of smoke fought the rain around the jagged edges of the\\nopening. The door hung off its hinges, jammed in the doorframe at an angle slanting into the hall.\\nWith a feeling of woozy unreality he stood the lamp up. It seemed the most important thing in the\\nworld was making sure it did not break.\\nA pile of crates suddenly heaved apart, and Mat stood up in the middle of it. He weaved on his\\nfeet, blinking and fumbling at himself as if wondering if everything was still attached. He peered\\ntoward Rand. “Rand? Is that you? You’re alive. I thought we were both—” He broke off, biting his\\nlip and shaking. It took Rand a moment to realize he was laughing, and on the edge of hysteria.\\n“What happened, Mat? Mat? Mat!

It was easier than it had been an hour earlier.\\nHis arms felt as if they might stretch instead of drawing him up, and for a minute his head wanted to\\nkeep on going and float away, but it was easier. He hooked his elbows over the low slats and\\nwatched the land roll past. The sun, still hidden by dull clouds, yet stood high overhead, but the cart\\nwas clattering into another village of vine-covered, red brick houses. Towns had been getting closer\\ntogether since Four Kings.\\nSome of the people waved or called a greeting to Hyam Kinch, the farmer whose cart it was.\\nMaster Kinch, leathery-faced and taciturn, shouted back a few words each time, around the pipe in his\\nteeth. The clenched teeth made what he said all but unintelligible, but it sounded jovial and seemed to\\nsatisfy; they went back to what they were doing without another glance at the cart. No one appeared to\\npay any mind to the farmer’s two passengers.\\nThe village inn moved through Rand’s field of vision. It was whitewashed, with a gray slate\\nroof. People bustled in and out, nodding casually and waving to one another. Some of them stopped to\\nspeak. They knew one another. Villagers, mostly, by their clothes—boots and trousers and coats not\\nmuch different from what he wore himself, though with an inordinate fondness for colorful stripes.\\nThe women wore deep bonnets that hid their faces and white aprons with stripes. Maybe they were\\nall townsmen and local farmfolk. \\nDoes that make any difference?\\nHe dropped back on the straw, watching the village dwindle between his feet. Fenced fields and\\ntrimmed hedges lined the road, and small farmhouses with smoke rising from red brick chimneys. The\\nonly woods near the road were coppices, well tended for firewood, tame as a farmyard. But the\\nbranches stood leafless against the sky, as stark as in the wild woods to the west.\\nA line of wagons heading the other way rumbled down the center of the road, crowding the cart\\nover onto the verge. Master Kinch shifted his pipe to the corner of his mouth and spat between his\\nteeth. With one eye on his off-side wheel, to make sure it did not tangle in the hedge, he kept the cart\\nmoving. His mouth tightened as he glanced at the merchants’ train.\\nNone of the wagon drivers cracking their long whips in the air above eight-horse teams, none of\\nthe hard-faced guards slouching in their saddles alongside the wagons, looked at the cart. Rand\\nwatched them go, his chest tight. His hand was under his cloak, gripping his sword hilt, until the last\\nwagon lurched by.\\nAs that final wagon rattled away toward the village they had just left, Mat turned on the seat\\nbeside the farmer and leaned back until he found Rand’s eyes.

Each man’s conical\\nhelmet shone like silver. They sat their horses with straight backs. Thin red streamers fluttered\\nbeneath the heads of their lances, every lance held at the same angle.\\nSome of them glanced into the cart as they passed in two columns. A cage of steel bars masked\\neach face. Rand was glad his cloak covered his sword. A few nodded to Master Kinch, not as if they\\nknew him, but in a neutral greeting. Master Kinch nodded back in much the same way, but despite his\\nunchanging expression there was a hint of approval in his nod.\\nTheir horses were at a walk, but with the speed of the cart added, they went by quickly. With a\\npart of his mind Rand counted them. Ten . . .  twenty . . .  thirty . . .  thirty-two. He raised his head to\\nwatch the columns move on down the Caemlyn Road.\\n“Who were they?” Mat asked, half wondering, half suspicious.\\n“Queen’s Guards,” Master Kinch said around his pipe. He kept his eyes on the road ahead.\\n“Won’t go much further than Breen’s Spring, ’less they’re called for. Not like the old days.” He\\nsucked on his pipe, then added, “I suppose, these days, there’s parts of the Realm don’t see the\\nGuards in a year or more. Not like the old days.”\\n“What are they doing?” Rand asked.\\nThe farmer gave him a look. “Keeping the Queen’s peace and upholding the Queen’s law.” He\\nnodded to himself as if he liked the sound of that, and added, “Searching out malefactors and seeing\\nthem before a magistrate. Mmmph!” He let out a long streamer of smoke. “You two must be from\\npretty far off not to recognize the Queen’s Guard. Where you from?”\\n“Far off,” Mat said at the same instant that Rand said, “The Two Rivers.” He wished he could\\ntake it back as soon as he said it. He still was not thinking clearly. Trying to hide, and mentioning a\\nname a Fade would hear like a bell.\\nMaster Kinch glanced at Mat out of the corner of his eye, and puffed his pipe in silence for a\\nwhile. “That’s far off, all right,” he said finally. “Almost to the border of the Realm. But things must\\nbe worse than I thought if there’s places in the Realm where people don’t even \\nrecognize\\n the Queen’s\\nGuards. Not like the old days at all.”\\nRand wondered what Master al’Vere would say if someone told him the Two Rivers was part of\\nsome Queen’s Realm. The Queen of Andor, he supposed. Perhaps the Mayor did know—he knew a\\nlot of things that surprised Rand—and maybe others did, too, but he had never heard anyone mention\\nit. The Two Rivers was the Two Rivers.

Least, it would if your friend had his legs\\nunder him.”\\nMat hopped down and retrieved his bow and other things, then helped Rand climb off the tail of\\nthe cart. Rand’s bundles weighed on him, and his legs wobbled, but he shrugged off his friend’s hand\\nand tried a few steps on his own. He still felt unsteady, but his legs held him up. They even seemed to\\ngrow stronger as he used them.\\nThe farmer did not start his horse up again right away. He studied them for a minute, sucking on\\nhis pipe. “You can rest up a day or two at my place, if you want. Won’t miss anything in that time, I\\nsuppose.

It can’t be\\neverybody.\\n“Thank you,” he said, “but I’m all right. Really. How far to the next village?”\\n“Carysford? You can reach it before dark, walking.” Master Kinch took his pipe from between\\nhis teeth and pursed his lips thoughtfully before going on. “First off, I reckoned you for runaway\\n’prentices, but now I expect it’s something more serious you’re running from. Don’t know what. Don’t\\ncare. I’m a good enough judge to say you’re not Darkfriends, and not likely to rob or hurt anybody.\\nNot like some on the road these days. I got in trouble a time or two myself when I was your age. You\\nneed a place to keep out of sight a few days, my farm is five miles that way”—he jerked his head\\ntoward the cart track—“and don’t nobody ever come out there. Whatever’s chasing you, won’t likely\\nfind you there.” He cleared his throat as if embarrassed by speaking so many words together.\\n“How would you know what Darkfriends look like?” Mat demanded. He backed away from the\\ncart, and his hand went under his coat. “What do you know about Darkfriends?”\\nMaster Kinch’s face tightened. “Suit yourselves,” he said, and clucked to his horse. The cart\\nrolled off down the narrow path, and he never looked back.\\nMat looked at Rand, and his scowl faded. “Sorry, Rand. You need a place to rest.

He was sure if\\nhe turned quickly enough he would see. . . . He was not sure what, but it made him uneasy, thinking\\nabout it.\\nThe Dancing Cartman appeared in front of him.

He was surprised that he was not afraid. Perhaps it was knowing\\nthat it was a dream this time.\\n“Yes,” said Ba’alzamon’s voice, “but he did find you for me. That deserves some reward, don’t\\nyou think?”\\nRand turned, and discovered he could be afraid, even knowing it was a dream. Ba’alzamon’s\\nclothes were the color of dried blood, and rage and hate and triumph battled on his face.\\n“You see, youngling, you cannot hide from me forever. One way or another I find you. What\\nprotects you also makes you vulnerable. One time you hide, the next you light a signal fire. Come to\\nme, youngling.” He held out his hand to Rand. “If my hounds must pull you down, they may not be\\ngentle. They are jealous of what you will be, once you have knelt at my feet. It is your destiny. You\\nbelong to me.” Gode’s burned tongue made an angry, eager garble of sound.\\nRand tried to wet his lips, but he had no spit in his mouth. “No,” he managed, and then the words'),\n",

If your Darkfriends kill me, you’ll\\nnever have me.”\\nThe fires in Ba’alzamon’s face heated the room till the air swam. “Alive or dead, youngling, you\\nare mine. The grave belongs to me. Easier dead, but better alive. Better for you, youngling. The living\\nhave more power in most things.” Gode made a gabbling sound again. “Yes, my good hound. Here is\\nyour reward.”\\nRand looked at Gode just in time to see the man’s body crumble to dust.

Gode’s empty velvet garments settled on the chair and the floor\\namong the ash.\\nWhen he turned back, Ba’alzamon’s outstretched hand had become a fist. “You are mine,\\nyoungling, alive or dead. The Eye of the World will never serve you. I mark you as mine.” His fist\\nopened, and a ball of flame shot out. It struck Rand in the face, exploding, searing.\\nRand lurched awake in the dark, water dripping through the cloaks onto his face. His hand\\ntrembled as he touched his cheeks. The skin felt tender, as if sunburned.\\nSuddenly he realized Mat was twisting and moaning in his sleep. He shook him, and Mat came\\nawake with a whimper.\\n“My eyes! Oh, Light, my eyes! He took my eyes!”\\nRand held him close, cradling him against his chest as if he were a baby. “You’re all right, Mat.\\nYou’re all right. He can’t hurt us. We won’t let him.” He could feel Mat shaking, sobbing into his\\ncoat. “He can’t hurt us,” he whispered, and wished he believed it. \\nWhat protects you makes you\\nvulnerable. I\\n am \\ngoing mad.\\nJust before first light the downpour dwindled, the last drizzle fading as dawn came. The clouds\\nremained, threatening until well into the morning. The wind came up, then, driving the clouds off to\\nthe south, baring a warmthless sun and slicing through their dripping wet clothes. They had not slept\\nagain, but groggily they donned their cloaks and set off eastward, Rand leading Mat by the hand. After\\na while Mat even felt well enough to complain about what the rain had done to his bowstring. Rand\\nwould not let him stop to exchange it for a dry string from his pocket, though; not yet.\\nThey came on another village shortly after midday. Rand shivered harder at the sight of snug\\nbrick houses and smoke rising from chimneys, but he kept clear, leading Mat through the woods and\\nfields to the south. A lone farmer working with a spading fork in a muddy field was the only person\\nhe saw, and he took care that the man did not see them, crouching through the trees. The farmer’s\\nattention was all on his work, but Rand kept one eye on him till he was lost to sight. If any of Gode’s\\nmen were alive, perhaps they would believe he and Mat had taken the southern road out of Four\\nKings when they could not find anyone who had seen them in this village. They came back to the road\\nout of sight of the town, and walked their clothes, if not dry, at least to just damp.\\nAn hour beyond the town a farmer gave them a ride in his half-empty haywain. Rand had been\\ntaken by surprise while lost in worry about Mat. Mat shielded his eyes from the sun with his hand,\\nweak as the afternoon light was, squinting through slitted lids even so, and he muttered continually\\nabout how bright the sun was. When Rand heard the rumble of the haywain, it was too late already.\\nThe sodden road deadened sound, and the wagon with its two-horse hitch was only fifty yards behind\\nthem, the driver already peering at them.\\nTo Rand’s surprise he drew up and offered them a lift. Rand hesitated, but it was too late to\\navoid being seen, and refusing a ride might fix them in the man’s mind. He helped Mat up to the seat\\nbeside the farmer, then climbed up behind him.'),\n",

His cows had gone dry, his chickens had\\nstopped laying, and there was no pasture worth the name. For the first time in memory he had had to\\nbuy hay, and half a wagon was all “old Bain” would let him have. He wondered whether there was\\nany chance of getting hay on his own land this year, or any kind of crop.\\n“The Queen should do something, the Light illumine her,” he muttered, knuckling his forehead\\nrespectfully but absentmindedly.\\nHe hardly looked at Rand or Mat, but when he let them down by the narrow, rail-lined track that\\nled off to his farm, he hesitated, then said, almost as if to himself, “I don’t know what you’re running\\nfrom, and I don’t want to. I have a wife and children. You understand? My family. It’s hard times for\\nhelping strangers.”\\nMat tried to stick his hand under his coat, but Rand had his wrist and he held on. He stood in the\\nroad, looking at the man without speaking.\\n“If I was a good man,” Mull said, “I’d offer a couple of lads soaked to the skin a place to dry out\\nand get warm in front of my fire. But it’s hard times, and strangers . . . . I don’t know what you’re\\nrunning from, and I don’t want to. You understand?

It’s hard times.”\\n“We never even saw you,” Rand agreed as he took the scarves. “You \\nare\\n a good man. The best\\nwe’ve met in days.”\\nThe farmer looked surprised, then grateful. Gathering his reins, he turned his horses down the\\nnarrow lane. Before he completed the turn Rand was leading Mat on down the Caemlyn Road.\\nThe wind stiffened as dusk closed in. Mat began to ask querulously when they were going to\\nstop, but Rand kept moving, pulling Mat behind him, searching for more shelter than a spot under a\\nhedge. With their clothes still clammy and the wind getting colder by the minute, he was not sure they\\ncould survive another night in the open. Night fell without him spotting anything useful. The wind\\ngrew icy, beating his cloak. Then, through the darkness ahead, he saw lights. A village.\\nHis hand slid into his pocket, feeling the coins there. More than enough for a meal and a room\\nfor the two of them. A room out of the cold night. If they stayed in the open, in the wind and cold in\\ndamp clothes, anyone who found them would likely as not find only two corpses. They just had to\\nkeep from attracting any more notice than they could help. No playing the flute, and with his eyes, Mat\\ncertainly could not juggle. He grasped Mat’s hand again and set out toward the beckoning lights.\\n“When are we going to stop?” Mat asked again. The way he peered ahead, with his head stuck\\nforward, Rand was not sure if Mat could see him, much less the village lights.\\n“When we’re somewhere warm,” he replied.\\nPools of light from house windows lit the streets of the town, and people walked them\\nunconcerned with what might be out in the dark. The only inn was a sprawling building, all on one\\nfloor, with the look of having had rooms added in bunches over the years without any particular plan.\\nThe front door opened to let someone out, and a wave of laughter rolled out after him.\\nRand froze in the street, the drunken laughter at The Dancing Cartman echoing in his head. He\\nwatched the man go down the street with a none-too-steady stride, then took a deep breath and pushed\\nthe door open. He took care that his cloak covered his sword. Laughter swept over him.\\nLamps hanging from the high ceiling made the room bright, and right away he could see and feel\\nthe difference from Saml Hake’s inn. There was no drunkenness here, for one thing. The room was\\nfilled with people who looked to be farmers and townsmen, if not entirely sober, not too far from it.'),\n",

Mat sighed and reluctantly emptied his pocket. When the\\nreckoning was paid, Rand grimaced at the little that remained to divide with Mat.\\nBut ten minutes later they were eating stew at a table in a corner near the fireplace, pushing it\\nonto their spoons with chunks of bread. The portions were not as large as Rand could have wished,\\nbut they were hot, and filling. Warmth from the hearth seeped into him slowly. He pretended to keep\\nhis eyes on his plate, but he watched the door intently. Those who came in or went out all looked like\\nfarmers, but it was not enough to quiet his fear.\\nMat ate slowly, savoring each bite, though he muttered about the light from the lamps. After a\\ntime he dug out the scarf Alpert Mull had given him and wound it around his forehead, pulling it down\\nuntil his eyes were almost hidden.

All of his clothes were still damp and\\nuncomfortable, but if they had to run, he wanted to be ready. He left the sword belt on, too, and slept\\nwith his hand on the hilt.\\nA rooster crowing jerked him awake in the morning. He lay there, watching dawn lighten the\\nwindow, and wondered if he dared sleep a little longer. Sleep during daylight, when they could be\\nmoving. A yawn made his jaws crack.\\n“Hey,” Mat exclaimed, “I can see!” He sat up on his bed, squinting around the room. “Some,\\nanyway. Your face is still a little blurry, but I can tell who you are.

The young man’s eyes swept jauntily around the room, but when they lit on Rand and Mat, the\\ncap fell off his finger.

Ah . . .  call me Paitr.” His eyes shifted nervously. “Ah . . .  this is not my\\nidea, you understand. I have to do it. I didn’t want to, but they made me. You have to understand that.

After Gode, he knew that Darkfriends did not necessarily have the\\nDragon’s Fang on their foreheads, but except for his clothes this Paitr could have fit right in Emond’s\\nField.

If Paitr discovered that Mat was almost blind, he would tell others . . . \\nother Darkfriends. Once Rand had seen a wolf separate a crippled sheep from the flock; there were\\nother wolves around, and he could neither leave the flock nor get a clear shot with his bow.

Leave—\\nus—alone.”\\nPaitr swallowed hard and pressed back in his chair; there was no blood left in his face at all. It\\nmade Rand think of a Myrddraal.\\nBy the time he looked back at Mat, Mat was on his feet, his awkwardness unseen. Rand hastily\\nhung his own saddlebags and other bundles around him, trying to keep his cloak over the sword as he\\ndid. Maybe Paitr already knew about it; maybe Gode had told Ba’alzamon, and Ba’alzamon had told\\nPaitr; but he did not think so.

They were almost to the door, and Mat had\\nnot put a foot wrong yet.\\n“Just listen to me,” Paitr said, and put his hand on Rand’s shoulder to stop him.\\nImages spun in his head. The Trolloc, Narg, leaping at him in his own home. The Myrddraal\\nthreatening at the Stag and Lion in Baerlon. Halfmen everywhere, Fades chasing them to Shadar\\nLogoth, coming for them in Whitebridge. Darkfriends everywhere. He whirled, his hand balling up. “I\\nsaid, leave us alone!” His fist took Paitr flush on the nose.\\nThe Darkfriend fell on his bottom and sat there on the floor staring at Rand. Blood trickled from\\nhis nose. “You won’t get away,” he spat angrily. “No matter how strong you are, the Great Lord of the\\nDark is stronger. The Shadow will swallow you!”\\nThere was a gasp from further into the common room, and the clatter of a broom handle hitting\\nthe floor. The old man with the broom had finally heard. He stood staring wide-eyed at Paitr. The\\nblood drained from his wrinkled face and his mouth worked, but no sound came out.

A farmer told them that a crazy old man at the inn\\nin Market Sheran was claiming there were Darkfriends in the village. The farmer could hardly talk\\nfor laughing; he kept wiping tears off his cheeks. Darkfriends in Market Sheran! It was the best story\\nhe had heard since Ackley Farren got drunk and spent the night on the inn roof.\\nAnother man, a round-faced wagonwright with tools hanging from the sides of his cart and two\\nwagon wheels in the back, told a different story. Twenty Darkfriends had held a gathering in Market\\nSheran. Men with twisted bodies, and the women worse, all dirty and in rags. They could make your\\nknees grow weak and your stomach heave just by looking at you, and when they laughed, the filthy\\ncackles rang in your ears for hours and your head felt as if it were splitting open. He had seen them\\nhimself, just at a distance, far enough off to be safe. If the Queen would not do something, then\\nsomebody ought to ask the Children of the Light for help. Somebody should do something.\\nIt was a relief when the wagonwright let them down.\\nWith the sun low behind them they walked into a small village, much like Market Sheran. The\\nCaemlyn Road split the town neatly in two, but on both sides of the wide road stood rows of small\\nbrick houses with thatched roofs. Webs of vine covered the bricks, though only a few leaves hung on\\nthem. The village had one inn, a small place no bigger than the Winespring Inn, with a sign on a\\nbracket out front, creaking back and forth in the wind. The Queen’s Man.\\nStrange, to think of the Winespring Inn as small. Rand could remember when he thought it was\\nabout as big as a building could be. Anything bigger would be a palace. But he had seen a few things,\\nnow, and suddenly he realized that nothing would look the same to him when he got back home. \\nIf you\\never do.\\nHe hesitated in front of the inn, but even if prices at The Queen’s Man were not as high as in\\nMarket Sheran, they could not afford a meal or a room, either one.\\nMat saw where he was looking and patted the pocket where he kept Thom’s colored balls. “I\\ncan see well enough, as long as I don’t try to get too fancy.” His eyes had been getting better, though\\nhe still wore the scarf around his forehead, and had squinted whenever he looked at the sky during the\\nday. When Rand said nothing, Mat went on. “There can’t be Darkfriends at every inn between here\\nand Caemlyn. Besides, I don’t want to sleep under a bush if I can sleep in a bed.” He made no move\\ntoward the inn, though, just stood waiting for Rand.\\nAfter a moment Rand nodded. He felt as tired as he had at any time since leaving home. Just\\nthinking of a night in the open made his bones ache. \\nIt’s all catching up. All the running, all the\\nlooking over your shoulder.\\n“They can’t be everywhere,” he agreed.\\nWith the first step he took into the common room, he wondered if he had made a mistake. It was\\na clean place, but crowded. Every table was filled, and some men leaned against the walls because\\nthere was nowhere for them to sit. From the way the serving maids scurried between the tables with\\nharried looks—and the landlord, too—it was a larger crowd than they were used to. Too many for\\nthis small village. It was easy to pick out the people who did not belong there. They were dressed no\\ndifferently from the rest, but they kept their eyes on their food and drink. The locals watched the\\nstrangers as much as anything else.\\nA drone of conversation hung in the air, enough that the innkeeper took them into the kitchen\\nwhen Rand made him understand that they needed to talk to him.

Well, it’s six to a room and two\\nor three to a bed, and if that doesn’t suit, I’ve nothing for you.”\\nRand gave his spiel with a feeling of queasiness. With so many people on the road, every other\\none could be a Darkfriend, and there was no way to pick them out from the rest.

After\\nonly a dozen notes of “The Old Black Bear,” the innkeeper nodded impatiently.\\n“You’ll do. I need something to take those idiots’ minds off this Logain. There’s been three\\nfights already over whether or not he’s really the Dragon. Stow your things in the corner, and I’ll go\\nclear a space for you. If there’s any room to. Fools.

His bones felt as if they were freezing.\\nDimly he was aware of Mat asking him something, shaking his shoulder, and of someone cursing\\nand running out of the room. Then the innkeeper was there, with the cook frowning at his side, and\\nMat was arguing loudly with them both. He could not make out any of what they said; the words were\\na buzz in his ears, and he could not seem to think at all.\\nSuddenly Mat took his arm, pulling him to his feet. All of their things—saddlebags, blanketrolls,\\nThom’s bundled cloak and instrument cases—hung from Mat’s shoulders with his bow. The innkeeper\\nwas watching them, wiping his face anxiously. Weaving, more than half supported by Mat, Rand let\\nhis friend steer him toward the back door.\\n“S-s-sorry, M-m-mat,” he managed.

He was trying to sound cheerful, but Rand could hear the hidden\\nworry. “He was scared the other folk would find out there was somebody sick in his inn. I told him if\\nhe kicked us out, I’d take you into the common room. That’d empty half his rooms in ten minutes. For\\nall his talk about fools, he doesn’t want that.”\\n“Then w-where?”\\n“Here,” Mat said, pulling open the stable door with a loud creak of hinges.\\nIt was darker inside than out, and the air smelled of hay and grain and horses, with a strong\\nundersmell of manure. When Mat lowered him to the straw-covered floor, he folded over with his\\nchest on his knees, still hugging himself and shaking from head to toe. All of his strength seemed to go\\nfor the shaking. He heard Mat stumble and curse and stumble again, then a clatter of metal. Suddenly\\nlight blossomed. Mat held up a battered old lantern.\\nIf the inn was full, so was its stable. Every stall had a horse, some raising their heads and\\nblinking at the light. Mat eyed the ladder to the hayloft, then looked at Rand, crouched on the floor,\\nand shook his head.'),\n",

He filled one of the\\ncups and held it to Rand’s mouth. Rand gulped the water down as if he had had nothing to drink in\\ndays; that was how he felt. “They don’t even know what a Wisdom is. What they do have is\\nsomebody called Mother Brune, but she’s off somewhere birthing a baby, and nobody knows when\\nshe’ll be back. I did get some bread, and cheese, and sausage. Good Master Inlow will give us\\nanything as long as we stay out of sight of his guests. Here, try some.”\\nRand turned his head away from the food. The sight of it, the thought of it, made his stomach\\nheave. After a minute Mat sighed and settled down to eat himself. Rand kept his eyes averted, and\\ntried not to listen.\\nThe chills came once more, and then the fever, to be replaced by the chills, and the fever again.\\nMat covered him when he shook, and fed him water when he complained of thirst. The night\\ndeepened, and the stable shifted in the flickering lantern light. Shadows took shape and moved on\\ntheir own. Then he saw Ba’alzamon striding down the stable, eyes burning, a Myrddraal at either side\\nwith faces hidden in the depths of their black cowls.\\nFingers scrabbling for his sword hilt, he tried to get to his feet, yelling, “Mat! Mat, they’re here!\\nLight, they’re here!”\\nMat jerked awake where he sat cross-legged against the wall. “What? Darkfriends? Where?”\\nWavering on his knees, Rand pointed frantically down the stable . . .  and gaped. Shadows\\nstirred, and a horse stamped in its sleep. Nothing more. He fell back on the straw.\\n“There’s nobody but us,” Mat said. “Here, let me take that.” He reached for Rand’s sword belt,\\nbut Rand tightened his grip on the hilt.\\n“No. No. I have to keep it. He’s my father. You understand? He’s m-my f-father!” The shivering\\nswept over him once more, but he clung to the sword as if to a lifeline. “M-my f-father!” Mat gave up\\ntrying to take it and pulled the cloaks back over him.\\nThere were other visitations in the night, while Mat dozed. Rand was never sure if they were\\nreally there or not. Sometimes he looked at Mat, with his head on his chest, wondering if he would\\nsee them, too, if he woke.\\nEgwene stepped out of the shadows, her hair in a long, dark braid as it had been in Emond’s\\nField, her face pained and mournful. “Why did you leave us?” she asked. “We’re dead because you\\nleft us.”\\nRand shook his head weakly on the hay. “No, Egwene. I didn’t want to leave you. Please.”\\n“We’re all dead,” she said sadly, “and death is the kingdom of the Dark One. The Dark One has\\nus, because you abandoned us.”\\n“No. I had no choice, Egwene. Please. Egwene, don’t go. Come back, Egwene!”\\nBut she turned into the shadows, and was shadow.'),\n",

Her cloak was a rich, soft gray, and a frothy net of lace caught up her hair. She fingered a\\nheavy gold necklace as she looked thoughtfully at Mat and him.\\n“Mat,” Rand said, then louder, “Mat!”'),\n",

Just a bare day since the nameless Darkfriend woman tried to kill them in the stable of\\nThe Queen’s Man, but even that seemed a year ago, or a lifetime.\\nWhatever was happening to time, Carysford appeared normal enough, on the surface, at least.\\nNeat, vine-covered brick houses and narrow lanes, except for the Caemlyn Road itself, quiet and\\noutwardly peaceful. \\nBut what’s underneath?\\n he wondered.

He had never learned the name of that one, and he did\\nnot want to think about it.\\nLight spilled from the windows of the houses into streets all but empty of people. That suited\\nRand.

Centuries of rain and wind had worn the stone abutments\\nuntil they seemed almost like natural formations. Years of freight wagons and merchant trains had\\nground at the thick wooden planks, too. Loose boards rattled under their boots, sounding as loud as\\ndrums. Until long after they were through the village and into the countryside beyond, Rand waited for\\na voice to demand to know who they were. Or worse, knowing who they were.\\nThe countryside had been filling up the further they went, becoming more and more settled.\\nThere were always the lights of farmhouses in sight. Hedges and rail fences lined the road and the\\nfields beyond. Always the fields were there, and never a stretch of woods close to the road. It seemed\\nas if they were always on the outskirts of a village, even when they were hours from the nearest town.\\nNeat and peaceful. And with never an indication that Darkfriends or worse might be lurking.\\nAbruptly Mat sat down in the road.

I’m not walking another ten paces unless there’s a place to sleep at the\\nend of it. Something to eat wouldn’t be amiss, either. You haven’t been hiding anything in your\\npockets, have you? An apple, maybe? I won’t hold it against you if you have. You could at least\\nlook.”\\nRand peered down the road both ways. They were the only things moving in the night.

Just us.”\\nRand shook his head. He knew Mat could not see in the darkness, but it was more for himself\\nthan Mat, anyway. “Go to sleep, Mat,” he said tiredly.

They looked at all the travelers the same\\nway, out of the corners of their eyes. Their faces said strangers might get up to anything if not\\nwatched.\\nPeople who lived in the area were not only wary of the strangers, they seemed more than a little\\nput out. Just enough people were on the road, scattered out just enough, that when farmers’ carts and\\nwagons appeared with the sun peeking over the horizon, even their usually slow pace was halved.\\nNone of them was in any mood to give a ride.

They gave no sign of slowing for anything, and he saw other folk scrambling out of the\\nway. He moved all the way over onto the verge, but kept walking.\\nA flicker of motion as the first wagon rumbled close was all the warning he had. He went\\nsprawling on the ground as the wagon driver’s whip cracked in the air where his head had been.\\nFrom where he lay he met the driver’s eyes as the wagon rolled by. Hard eyes above a mouth in a\\ntight grimace.

There were certainly enough of them. The\\nrattle and clatter of one hardly faded before another could be heard coming.

Some of the farmers hailed them, wanting something done about the strangers,\\nand the Guards always paused patiently to listen. Near midday Rand stopped to listen to one such\\nconversation.\\nBehind the bars of his helmet, the Guard captain’s mouth was a tight line. “If one of them steals\\nsomething, or trespasses on your land,” he growled at the lanky farmer frowning beside his stirrup,\\n“I’ll haul him before a magistrate, but they break no Queen’s Law by walking on the Queen’s\\nHighway.”'),\n",

Not every farm had the dogs out, but no one was offering jobs to travelers.\\nBefore the sun went down, he and Mat walked through two more villages. The village folk stood\\nin knots, talking among themselves and watching the steady stream pass by. Their faces were no\\nfriendlier than the faces of the farmers, or the wagon drivers, or the Queen’s Guards. All these\\nstrangers going to see the false Dragon.

With frequent glances over his shoulder, he quickened his step.\\nRand had to hurry to keep up.\\nThe night thickened, relieved only a bit by scant moonlight. Mat’s burst of energy faded, and his\\ncomplaints started up again. Aching knots formed in Rand’s calves. He told himself he had walked\\nfurther in a hard day working on the farm with Tam, but repeat it as often as he would, he could not\\nmake himself believe it. Gritting his teeth, he ignored the aches and pains and would not stop.\\nWith Mat complaining and him concentrating on the next step, they were almost on the village\\nbefore he saw the lights. He tottered to a stop, suddenly aware of a burning that ran from his feet right\\nup his legs. He thought he had a blister on his right foot.\\nAt the sight of the village lights, Mat sagged to his knees with a groan. “Can we stop now?” he'),\n",

Or a Fade.”\\n“The other side of the town,” Rand answered, staring at the lights. From this distance, in the\\ndark, it could have been Emond’s Field. \\nWhat’s waiting there?\\n “Another mile, that’s all.”\\n“All! I’m not walking another span!”\\nRand’s legs felt like fire, but he made himself take a step, and then another. It did not get any\\neasier, but he kept on, one step at a time. Before he had gone ten paces he heard Mat staggering after\\nhim, muttering under his breath. He thought it was just as well he could not make out what Mat was\\nsaying.\\nIt was late enough for the streets of the village to be empty, though most houses had a light in at\\nleast one window. The inn in the middle of town was brightly lit, surrounded by a golden pool that\\npushed back the darkness. Music and laughter, dimmed by thick walls, drifted from the building. The\\nsign over the door creaked in the wind. At the near end of the inn, a cart and horse stood in the\\nCaemlyn Road with a man checking the harness. Two men stood at the far end of the building, on the\\nvery edge of the light.\\nRand stopped in the shadows beside a house that stood dark. He was too tired to hunt through the\\nlanes for a way around. A minute resting could not hurt. Just a minute. Just until the men went away.\\nMat slumped against the wall with a grateful sigh, leaning back as if he meant to go to sleep right\\nthere.\\nSomething about the two men at the rim of the shadows made Rand uneasy. He could not put a\\nfinger on anything, at first, but he realized the man at the cart felt the same way about them. He\\nreached the end of the strap he was checking, adjusted the bit in the horse’s mouth, then went back and\\nstarted over from the beginning again. He kept his head down the whole while, his eyes on what he\\nwas doing and away from the other men. It could have been that he simply was not aware of them,\\nthough they were less than fifty feet off, except for the stiff way he moved and the way he sometimes\\nturned awkwardly in what he was doing so he would not be looking toward them.\\nOne of the men in the shadows was only a black shape, but the other stood more into the light,\\nwith his back to Rand. Even so it was plain he was not overjoyed at the conversation he was having.\\nHe wrung his hands and kept his eyes on the ground, jerking his head in a nod now and then at\\nsomething the other had said. Rand could not hear anything, but he got the impression that the man in\\nthe shadows was doing all the talking; the nervous man just listened, and nodded, and wrung his hands\\nanxiously.\\nEventually the one who was wrapped in darkness turned away, and the nervous fellow started\\nback into the light. Despite the chill he was mopping his face with the long apron he wore, as if he\\nwere drenched in sweat.\\nSkin prickling, Rand watched the shape moving off in the night. He did not know why, but his\\nuneasiness seemed to follow that one, a vague tingling in the back of his neck and the hair stirring on\\nhis arms as if he had suddenly realized something was sneaking up on him. With a quick shake of his\\nhead, he rubbed his arms briskly. \\nGetting as foolish as Mat, aren’t you?\\nAt that moment the form slipped by the edge of the light from a window—just on the brink of it\\n—and Rand’s skin crawled. The inn’s sign went \\nscree-scree-scree\\n in the wind, but the dark cloak\\nnever stirred.\\n“Fade,” he whispered, and Mat jerked to his feet as if he had shouted.\\n“What—?”\\nHe clamped a hand over Mat’s mouth. “Softly.” The dark shape was lost in the darkness.\\nWhere?\\n “It’s gone, now. I think. I hope.” He took his hand away; the only sound Mat made was a'),\n",

He stopped and smoothed down his apron, visibly\\ncomposing himself before he went inside.\\n“Strange friends you’ve got, Raimun Holdwin,” the man by the cart said suddenly. It was an old\\nman’s voice, but strong. The speaker straightened, shaking his head. “Strange friends in the dark for\\nan innkeeper.”\\nThe nervous man jumped when the other spoke, looking around as if he had not seen the cart and\\nthe other man until right then. He drew a deep breath and gathered himself, then asked sharply, “And\\nwhat do you mean by that, Almen Bunt?”\\n“Just what I said, Holdwin. Strange friends. He’s not from around here, is he? Lot of odd folk\\ncoming through the last few weeks. Awful lot of odd folk.”\\n“You’re a fine one to talk.” Holdwin cocked an eye at the man by the cart. “I know a lot of men,\\neven men from Caemlyn. Not like you, cooped up alone out on that farm of yours.” He paused, then\\nwent on as if he thought he had to explain further. “He’s from Four Kings. Looking for a couple of\\nthieves. Young men. They stole a heron-mark sword from him.”\\nRand’s breath had caught at the mention of Four Kings; at the mention of the sword he glanced at\\nMat. His friend had his back pressed hard against the wall and was staring into the darkness with\\neyes so wide they seemed to be all whites. Rand wanted to stare into the night, too—the Halfman\\ncould be anywhere—but his eyes went back to the two men in front of the inn.\\n“A heron-mark sword!” Bunt exclaimed. “No wonder he wants it back.”\\nHoldwin nodded. “Yes, and them, too. My friend’s a rich man, a . . . a merchant, and they’ve\\nbeen stirring up trouble with the men who work for him. Telling wild stories and getting people upset.\\nThey’re Darkfriends, and followers of Logain, too.”\\n“Darkfriends \\nand\\n followers of the false Dragon? And telling wild stories, too? Getting up to a\\nlot for young fellows. You did say they were young?” There was a sudden note of amusement in\\nBunt’s voice, but the innkeeper did not seem to notice.\\n“Yes. Not yet twenty. There’s a reward—a hundred crowns in gold—for the two of them.”\\nHoldwin hesitated, then added, “They’ve sly tongues, these two. The Light knows what kind of tales\\nthey’ll tell, trying to turn people against one another. And dangerous, too, even if they don’t look it.\\nVicious. Best you stay clear if you think you see them. Two young men, one with a sword, and both\\nlooking over their shoulders. If they’re the right ones, my . . . my friend will pick them up once they’re\\nlocated.”\\n“You sound almost as if you know them to look at.”\\n“I’ll know them when I see them,” Holdwin said confidently. “Just don’t try to take them\\nyourself. No need for anyone to get hurt. Come tell me if you see them. My . . . friend will deal with\\nthem. A hundred crowns for the two, but he wants the pair.”\\n“A hundred crowns for the two,” Bunt mused. “How much for this sword he wants so bad?”\\nAbruptly Holdwin appeared to realize the other man was making fun of him. “I don’t know why\\nI’m telling you,” he snapped. “You’re still fixed on that fool plan of yours, I see.”\\n“Not such a fool plan,” Bunt replied placidly. “There might not be another false Dragon to see\\nbefore I die—Light send it so!—and I’m too old to eat some merchant’s dust all the way to Caemlyn.\\nI’ll have the road to myself, and I’ll be in Caemlyn bright and early tomorrow.”\\n“To yourself?” The innkeeper’s voice had a nasty quiver. “You can never tell what might be out\\nin the night, Almen Bunt. All alone on the road, in the dark. Even if somebody hears you scream,\\nthere’s no one will unbar a door to help. Not these days, Bunt. Not your nearest neighbor.”'),\n",

Of course.” He threw a sideways look at the inn, then abruptly shoved\\nhis staff back under the cart seat. “Well, if you want a ride, get in.

Rand caught his arms and pulled him aboard.\\nThe village faded quickly into the night at the pace Bunt set. Rand lay back on the bare boards,\\nfighting the lulling creak of the wheels. Mat stifled his yawns with a fist, warily staring into the\\ncountryside.

Oh, I’ve heard all about Illian and Ebou Dar and Tear and all—\\nthere’s always some fool thinks a thing is bigger and better just because it’s off somewheres over the\\nhorizon—but for my money, Caemlyn is the grandest there is.

Even a blind pig finds an acorn sometimes. There’s got to be some\\nchanges. This weather, the crops failing, cows drying up, calves and lambs born dead, or with two\\nheads. Bloody ravens don’t even wait for things to die. People are scared. They want somebody to\\nblame. Dragon’s Fang turning up on people’s doors. Things creeping about in the night. Barns getting\\nburned. Fellows around like that friend of Holdwin, scaring people. The Queen’s got to do something\\nbefore it’s too late. You see that, don’t you?” Rand made a noncommittal sound. It sounded as if they\\nhad been even luckier than he had thought to find this old man and his cart. They might not have gotten\\nfurther than that last village if they had waited for daylight. Things creeping about in the night. He\\nlifted up to look over the side of the cart at the darkness. Shadows and shapes seemed to writhe in the\\nblack. He dropped back before his imagination convinced him there was something there.\\nBunt took it for agreement. “Right. I’m a good Queen’s man, and I’ll stand against any who try to\\nharm her, but I’m right. You take the Lady Elayne and the Lord Gawyn, now. There’s a change\\nwouldn’t harm anything, and might do some good. Sure, I know we’ve always done it that way in\\nAndor. Send the Daughter-Heir off to Tar Valon to study with the Aes Sedai, and the eldest son off to\\nstudy with the Warders. I believe in tradition, I do, but look what it got us last time. Luc dead in the\\nBlight before he was ever anointed First Prince of the Sword, and Tigraine vanished—run off or dead\\n—when it came time for her to take the throne. Still troubling us, that.\\n“There’s some saying she’s still alive, you know, that Morgase isn’t the rightful Queen. Bloody\\nfools. I remember what happened. Remember like it was yesterday. No Daughter-Heir to take the\\nthrone when the old Queen died, and every House in Andor scheming and fighting for the right. And\\nTaringail Damodred. You wouldn’t have thought he’d lost his wife, him hot to figure which House\\nwould win so he could marry again and become Prince Consort after all. Well, he managed it, though\\nwhy Morgase chose . . . ah, no man knows the mind of a woman, and a queen is twice a woman, wed\\nto a man, wed to the land. He got what he wanted, anyway, if not the way he wanted it.\\n“Brought Cairhien into the plotting before he was done, and you know how that ended. The Tree\\nchopped down, and black-veiled Aiel coming over the Dragonwall. Well, he got himself decently\\nkilled after he’d fathered Elayne and Gawyn, so there’s an end to it, I suppose. But why send them to\\nTar Valon? It’s time men didn’t think of the throne of Andor and Aes Sedai in the same thought\\nanymore. If they’ve got to go some place else to learn what they need, well, Illian’s got libraries as\\ngood as Tar Valon, and they’ll teach the Lady Elayne as much about ruling and scheming as ever the\\nwitches could. Nobody knows more about scheming than an Illianer. And if the Guards can’t teach the\\nLord Gawyn enough about soldiering, well, they’ve soldiers in Illian, too. And in Shienar, and Tear,\\nfor that matter. I’m a good Queen’s man, but I say let’s stop all this truck with Tar Valon. Three\\nthousand years is long enough. Too long. Queen Morgase can lead us and put things right without help\\nfrom the White Tower. I tell you, there’s a woman makes a man proud to kneel for her blessing. Why,'),\n",

He dreamed of Tam. At first they were at the big\\noak table in the farmhouse, drinking tea while Tam told him about Prince Consorts, and Daughter-\\nHeirs, and the Dragonwall, and black-veiled Aielmen. The heron-mark sword lay on the table\\nbetween them, but neither of them looked at it. Suddenly he was in the Westwood, pulling the\\nmakeshift litter through the moon-bright night. When he looked over his shoulder, it was Thom on the\\nlitter, not his father, sitting cross-legged and juggling in the moonlight.\\n“The Queen is wed to the land,” Thom said as brightly colored balls danced in a circle, “but the\\nDragon . . . the Dragon is one with the land, and the land is one with the Dragon.”\\nFurther back Rand saw a Fade coming, black cloak undisturbed by the wind, horse ghosting\\nsilently through the trees. Two severed heads hung at the Myrddraal’s saddlebow, dripping blood that\\nran in darker streams down its mount’s coal-black shoulder. Lan and Moiraine, faces distorted in\\ngrimaces of pain. The Fade pulled on a fistful of tethers as it rode. Each tether ran back to the bound\\nwrists of one of those who ran behind the soundless hooves, their faces blank with despair. Mat and\\nPerrin. And Egwene.\\n“Not her!” Rand shouted. “The Light blast you, it’s me you want, not her!”\\nThe Halfman gestured, and flames consumed Egwene, flesh crisping to ash, bone blacking and\\ncrumbling.\\n“The Dragon is one with the land,” Thom said, still juggling unconcernedly, “and the land is one\\nwith the Dragon.”\\nRand screamed . . . and opened his eyes.\\nThe cart creaked along the Caemlyn Road, filled with night and the sweetness of long-vanished\\nhay and the faint smell of horse. A shape blacker than the night rested on his chest, and eyes blacker\\nthan death looked into his.\\n“You are mine,” the raven said, and the sharp beak stabbed into his eye. He screamed as it\\nplucked his eyeball out of his head.\\nWith a throat-ripping shriek, he sat up, clapping both hands to his face.\\nEarly morning daylight bathed the cart. Dazed, he stared at his hands. No blood. No pain. The\\nrest of the dream was already fading, but that. . . . Gingerly he felt his face and shuddered.\\n“At least. . . .” Mat yawned, cracking his jaws. “At least you got some sleep.” There was little\\nsympathy in his bleary eyes. He was huddled under his cloak, with his blanketroll doubled up beneath\\nhis head. “He talked all bloody night.”\\n“You all the way awake?” Bunt said from the driver’s seat. “Gave me a start, you did, yelling\\nlike that.

He could not help laughing with relief. “We\\nmade it, Mat! I told you we’d. . . .” Words died in his mouth as his eyes fell on Caemlyn. After\\nBaerlon, even more after the ruins of Shadar Logoth, he had thought he knew what a great city would\\nlook like, but this . . . this was more than he would have believed.\\nOutside the great wall, buildings clustered as if every town he had passed through had been\\ngathered and set down there, side-by-side and all pushed together. Inns thrust their upper stories\\nabove the tile roofs of houses, and squat warehouses, broad and windowless, shouldered against them\\nall. Red brick and gray stone and plastered white, jumbled and mixed together, they spread as far as\\nthe eye could see. Baerlon could have vanished into it without being noticed, and Whitebridge\\nswallowed up twenty times over with hardly a ripple.\\nAnd the wall itself. The sheer, fifty-foot height of pale gray stone, streaked with silver and\\nwhite, swept out in a great circle, curving to north and south till he wondered how far it must run. All\\nalong its length towers rose, round and standing high above the wall’s own height, red-and-white\\nbanners whipping in the wind atop each one. From inside the wall other towers peeked out, slender\\ntowers even taller than those at the walls, and domes gleaming white and gold in the sun. A thousand\\nstories had painted cities in his mind, the great cities of kings and queens, of thrones and powers and\\nlegends, and Caemlyn fit into those mind-deep pictures as water fits into a jug.\\nThe cart creaked down the wide road toward the city, toward tower-flanked gates. The wagons\\nof a merchants’ train rolled out of those gates, under a vaulting archway in the stone that could have\\nlet a giant through, or ten giants abreast. Unwalled markets lined the road on both sides, roof tiles\\nglistening red and purple, with stalls and pens in the spaces between. Calves bawled, cattle lowed,\\ngeese honked, chickens clucked, goats bleated, sheep baaed, and people bargained at the top of their\\nlungs. A wall of noise funneled them toward the gates of Caemlyn.\\n“What did I tell you?” Bunt had to raise his voice to near a shout in order to be heard. “The\\ngrandest city in the world. Built by Ogier, you know. Least, the Inner City and the Palace were. It’s\\nthat old, Caemlyn is. Caemlyn, where good Queen Morgase, the Light illumine her, makes the law and\\nholds the peace for Andor. The greatest city on earth.”\\nRand was ready to agree. His mouth hung open, and he wanted to put his hands over his ears to\\nshut out the din. People crowded the road, as thick as folk in Emond’s Field crowded the Green at\\nBel Tine.

So bloody many. Light, the noise!”\\nRand looked at Bunt before answering. The farmer was caught up in staring at the city; with the\\nnoise, he might not have heard anyway. Still, Rand put his mouth close to Mat’s ear. “How can they\\nfind us among so many? Can’t you see it, you wool-headed idiot? We’re safe, if you ever learn to\\nwatch your bloody tongue!” He flung out a hand to take in everything, the markets, the city walls still\\nahead. “Look at it, Mat! Anything could happen here. Anything! We might even find Moiraine waiting\\nfor us, and Egwene, and all the rest.”\\n“If they’re alive. If you ask me, they’re as dead as the gleeman.”\\nThe grin faded from Rand’s face, and he turned to watch the gates come nearer. Anything could\\nhappen in a city like Caemlyn. He held that thought stubbornly.\\nThe horse could not move any faster, flap the reins as Bunt would; the closer to the gates they\\ncame, the thicker the crowd grew, jostling together shoulder to shoulder, pressing against the carts\\nand wagons heading in. Rand was glad to see a good many were dusty young men afoot with little in\\nthe way of belongings. Whatever their ages, a lot of the crowd pushing toward the gates had a travel-\\nworn look, rickety carts and tired horses, clothes wrinkled from many nights of sleeping rough,\\ndragging steps and weary eyes. But weary or not, those eyes were fixed on the gates as if getting\\ninside the walls would strip away all their fatigue.\\nHalf a dozen of the Queen’s Guards stood at the gates, their clean red-and-white tabards and\\nburnished plate-and-mail a sharp contrast to most of the people streaming under the stone arch. Backs\\nrigid and heads straight, they eyed the incomers with disdainful wariness. It was plain they would just\\nas soon have turned away most of those coming in. Aside from keeping a way clear for traffic leaving\\nthe city, though, and having a hard word with those who tried to push too fast, they did not hinder\\nanyone.\\n“Keep your places. Don’t push. Don’t push, the Light blind you! There’s room for everybody, the\\nLight help us. Keep your places.”\\nBunt’s cart rolled past the gates with the slow tide of the throng, into Caemlyn.\\nThe city rose on low hills, like steps climbing to a center. Another wall encircled that center,\\nshining pure white and running over the hills. Inside that were even more towers and domes, white\\nand gold and purple, their elevation atop the hills making them seem to look down on the rest of\\nCaemlyn. Rand thought that must be the Inner City of which Bunt had spoken.\\nThe Caemlyn Road itself changed as soon as it was inside the city, becoming a wide boulevard,\\nsplit down the middle by broad strips of grass and trees. The grass was brown and the tree branches\\nbare, but people hurried by as if they saw nothing unusual, laughing, talking, arguing, doing all the\\nthings that people do. Just as if they had no idea that there had been no spring yet this year and might\\nbe none. They did not see, Rand realized, could not or would not. Their eyes slid away from leafless\\nbranches, and they walked across the dead and dying grass without once looking down. What they did\\nnot see, they could ignore; what they did not see was not really there.\\nGaping at the city and the people, Rand was taken by surprise when the cart turned down a side\\nstreet, narrower than the boulevard, but still twice as wide as any street in Emond’s Field. Bunt drew\\nthe horse to a halt and turned to look back at them hesitantly. The traffic was a bit lighter here; the\\ncrowd split around the cart without breaking stride.\\n“What you’re hiding under your cloak, is it really what Holdwin says?”\\nRand was in the act of tossing his saddlebags over his shoulder. He did not even twitch. “What'),\n",

His stomach was a sour knot, but his voice was steady.\\nMat stifled a yawn with one hand, but he shoved the other under his coat—clutching the dagger\\nfrom Shadar Logoth, Rand knew—and his eyes had a hard, hunted look under the scarf around his\\nhead. Bunt avoided looking at Mat, as if he knew there was a weapon in that hidden hand.\\n“Don’t mean nothing, I suppose. Look, now, if you heard I was coming to Caemlyn, you were\\nthere long enough to hear the rest. Was I after a reward, I’d have made some excuse to go in the\\nGoose and Crown, speak to Holdwin. Only I don’t much like Holdwin, and I don’t like that friend of\\nhis, not at all. Seems like he wants you two more than he wants . . . anything else.”\\n“I don’t know what he wants,” Rand said. “We’ve never seen him before.” It might even be the\\ntruth; he could not tell one Fade from another.\\n“Uh-huh. Well, like I say, I don’t know nothing, and I guess I don’t want to. There’s enough\\ntrouble around for everybody without I go looking for more.”\\nMat was slow in gathering his things, and Rand was already in the street before he started\\nclimbing down. Rand waited impatiently. Mat turned stiffly from the cart, hugging bow and quiver\\nand blanketroll to his chest, muttering under his breath. Heavy shadows darkened the undersides of\\nhis eyes.\\nRand’s stomach rumbled, and he grimaced. Hunger combined with a sour twisting in his gut\\nmade him afraid he was going to vomit. Mat was staring at him now, expectantly. \\nWhich way to go?\\nWhat to do now?\\nBunt leaned over and beckoned him closer. He went, hoping for advice about Caemlyn.\\n“I’d hide that. . . .” The old farmer paused and looked around warily. People pushed by on both\\nsides of the cart, but except for a few passing curses about blocking the way, no one paid them any\\nattention. “Stop wearing it,” he said, “hide it, sell it. Give it away. That’s my advice. Thing like that’s\\ngoing to draw attention, and I guess you don’t want any of that.”\\nAbruptly he straightened, clucking to his horse, and drove slowly on down the crowded street\\nwithout another word or a backward glance. A wagon loaded with barrels rumbled toward them.\\nRand jumped out of the way, staggered, and when he looked again Bunt and his cart were lost to sight.\\n“What do we do now?” Mat demanded. He licked his lips, staring wide-eyed at all the people\\npushing by and the buildings towering as much as six stories above the street. “We’re in Caemlyn, but\\nwhat do we do?” He had uncovered his ears, but his hands twitched as if he wanted to put them back.\\nA hum lay on the city, the low, steady drone of hundreds of shops working, thousands of people\\ntalking. To Rand it was like being inside a giant beehive, constantly buzzing. “Even if they are here,\\nRand, how could we find them in all of this?”\\n“Moiraine will find us,” Rand said slowly. The immensity of the city was a weight on his\\nshoulders; he wanted to get away, to hide from all the people and noise. The void eluded him despite\\nTam’s teachings; his eyes drew the city into it. He concentrated instead on what was right around him,\\nignoring everything that lay beyond. Just looking at that one street, it almost seemed like Baerlon.\\nBaerlon, the last place they had all thought they were safe. \\nNobody’s safe anymore. Maybe they\\n are\\nall dead.

What if nobody does but the . . .\\nthe. . . .” He shuddered, unable to say it.\\n“We’ll think about that when it happens,” he told Mat firmly. “If it happens.” The worst meant\\nseeking out Elaida, the Aes Sedai in the Palace.

I want to go home. Laugh if you want; I\\ndon’t care. What I wouldn’t give to have my mother blessing me out for something right now. It’s like\\nweights on my brain; hot weights.

Two roughly\\ndressed men, who seemed to have been just passing by up till then, jumped on him before he was\\nclear. The crowd that had stopped to watch began to turn ugly, muttering and shaking fists. Rand\\npulled at Mat’s sleeve and hurried on. Mat needed no second urging. The roar of a small riot\\nfollowed them down the street.\\nSeveral times men approached the two of them instead of the other way around. Their dusty\\nclothes marked them as newcomers, and seemed to act like a magnet on some types. Furtive fellows\\nwho offered relics of Logain for sale with darting eyes and feet set to run. Rand calculated he was\\noffered enough scraps of the false Dragon’s cloak and fragments of his sword to make two swords\\nand half a dozen cloaks. Mat’s face brightened with interest, the first time at least, but Rand gave them\\nall a curt no, and they took it with a bob of the head and a quick, “Light illumine the Queen, good\\nmaster,” and vanished. Most of the shops had plates and cups painted with fanciful scenes purporting\\nto show the false Dragon being displayed before the Queen in chains. And there were Whitecloaks in\\nthe streets. Each walked in an open space that moved with him, just as in Baerlon.\\nStaying unnoticed was something Rand thought about a great deal. He kept his cloak over his\\nsword, but that would not be good enough for very long. Sooner or later someone would wonder what\\nhe was hiding. He would not—could not—take Bunt’s advice to stop wearing it, not his link to Tam.\\nTo his father.\\nMany others among the throng wore swords, but none with the heronmark to pull the eye. All the\\nCaemlyn men, though, and some of the strangers, had their swords wound in strips of cloth, sheath and\\nhilt, red bound with white cord, or white bound with red. A hundred heron-marks could be hidden\\nunder those wrappings and no one would see. Besides, following local fashion would make them\\nseem to fit in more.\\nA good many shops were fronted with tables displaying the cloth and cord, and Rand stopped at\\none. The red cloth was cheaper than the white, though he could see no difference apart from the color,\\nso he bought that and the white cord to go with it, despite Mat’s complaints about how little money\\nthey had left. The tight-lipped shopkeeper eyed them up and down with a twist to his mouth while he\\ntook Rand’s coppers, and cursed them when Rand asked for a place inside to wrap his sword.\\n“We didn’t come to see Logain,” Rand said patiently. “We just came to see Caemlyn.” He\\nremembered Bunt, and added, “The grandest city in the world.” The shopkeeper’s grimace remained\\nin place. “The Light illumine good Queen Morgase,” Rand said hopefully.\\n“You make any trouble,” the man said sourly, “and there’s a hundred men in sound of my voice\\nwill take care of you even if the Guards won’t.” He paused to spit, just missing Rand’s foot. “Get on\\nabout your filthy business.”\\nRand nodded as if the man had bid him a cheerful farewell, and pulled Mat away. Mat kept\\nlooking back over his shoulder toward the shop, growling to himself, until Rand tugged him into an\\nempty alleyway. With their backs to the street no passerby could see what they were doing. Rand\\npulled off the sword belt and set to wrapping the sheath and hilt.\\n“I’ll bet he charged you double for that bloody cloth,” Mat said. “Triple.”\\nIt was not as easy as it looked, fastening the strips of cloth and the cord so the whole thing would\\nnot fall off.\\n“They’ll all be trying to cheat us, Rand. They think we’ve come to see the false Dragon, like\\neverybody else. We’ll be lucky if somebody doesn’t hit us on the head while we sleep. This is no\\nplace to be. There are too many people.

As he went back out on the street, he was\\nsure that he had one less thing to worry about causing trouble. Mat trailed along beside him as\\nreluctantly as if he were being pulled on a leash.\\nBit by bit Rand did get the directions he wanted. At first they were vague, on the order of\\n“somewhere in that direction” and “over that way.” The nearer they came, though, the clearer the\\ninstructions, until at last they stood before a broad stone building with a sign over the door creaking\\nin the wind. A man kneeling before a woman with red-gold hair and a crown, one of her hands resting\\non his bowed head. The Queen’s Blessing.\\n“Are you sure about this?” Mat asked.\\n“Of course,” Rand said. He took a deep breath and pushed open the door.\\nThe common room was large and paneled with dark wood, and fires on two hearths warmed it.\\nA serving maid was sweeping the floor, though it was clean, and another was polishing candlesticks\\nin the corner. Each smiled at the two newcomers before going back to her work.\\nOnly a few tables had people at them, but a dozen men was a crowd for so early in the day, and\\nif none looked exactly happy to see him and Mat, at least they looked clean and sober. The smells of\\nroasting beef and baking bread drifted from the kitchen, making Rand’s mouth water.\\nThe innkeeper was fat, he was pleased to see, a pink-faced man in a starched white apron, with\\ngraying hair combed back over a bald spot that it did not quite cover. His sharp eye took them in from\\nhead to toe, dusty clothes and bundles and worn boots, but he had a ready, pleasant smile, too. Basel\\nGill was his name.\\n“Master Gill,” Rand said, “a friend of ours told us to come here. Thom Merrilin. He—” The\\ninnkeeper’s smile slipped. Rand looked at Mat, but he was too busy sniffing the aromas coming from\\nthe kitchen to notice anything else. “Is something wrong? You do know him?”\\n“I know him,” Gill said curtly. He seemed more interested in the flute case at Rand’s side now,\\nthan in anything else. “Come with me.” He jerked his head toward the back. Rand gave Mat a jerk to\\nget him started, then followed, wondering what was going on.\\nIn the kitchen, Master Gill paused to speak to the cook, a round woman with her hair in a bun at\\nthe back of her head who almost matched the innkeeper pound for pound. She kept stirring her pots\\nwhile Master Gill talked. The smells were so good—two days’ hunger made a fine sauce for\\nanything, but this smelled as good as Mistress al’Vere’s kitchen—that Rand’s stomach growled. Mat\\nwas leaning toward the pots, nose first. Rand nudged him; Mat hastily wiped his chin where he had\\nbegun drooling.\\nThen the innkeeper was hurrying them out the back door. In the stableyard he looked around to\\nmake sure no one was close, then rounded on them. On Rand. “What’s in the case, lad?”\\n“Thom’s flute,” Rand said slowly. He opened the case, as if showing the gold-and-silver-chased\\nflute would help. Mat’s hand crept under his coat.\\nMaster Gill did not take his eyes off Rand. “Aye, I recognize it. I saw him play it often enough,\\nand there’s not likely two like that outside a royal court.” The pleasant smiles were gone, and his\\nsharp eyes were suddenly as sharp as a knife. “How did you come by it? Thom would part with his\\narm as soon as that flute.”\\n“He gave it to me.” Rand took Thom’s bundled cloak from his back and set it on the ground,\\nunfolding enough to show the colored patches, as well as the end of the harp case. “Thom’s dead,'),\n",

How?”\\n“A . . . a man tried to kill us. Thom pushed this at me and told us to run.” The patches fluttered in\\nthe wind like butterflies. Rand’s throat caught; he folded the cloak carefully back up again. “We’d\\nhave been killed if it hadn’t been for him. We were on our way to Caemlyn together. He told us to\\ncome here, to your inn.”\\n“I’ll believe he’s dead,” the innkeeper said slowly, “when I see his corpse.” He nudged the\\nbundled cloak with his toe and cleared his throat roughly. “Nay, nay, I believe you saw Whatever it\\nwas you saw; I just don’t believe he’s dead. He’s a harder man to kill than you might believe, is old\\nThom Merrilin.”\\nRand put a hand on Mat’s shoulder. “It’s all right, Mat. He’s a friend.”\\nMaster Gill glanced at Mat, and sighed. “I suppose I am at that.”\\nMat straightened up slowly, folding his arms over his chest. He was still watching the innkeeper\\nwarily, though, and a muscle in his cheek twitched.\\n“Coming to Caemlyn, you say?” The innkeeper shook his head. “This is the last place on earth\\nI’d expect Thom to come, excepting maybe it was Tar Valon.” He waited for a stableman to pass,\\nleading a horse, and even then he lowered his voice. “You’ve trouble with the Aes Sedai, I take it.”\\n“Yes,” Mat grumbled at the same time that Rand said, “What makes you think that?”\\nMaster Gill chuckled dryly. “I know the man, that’s what. He’d jump into that kind of trouble,\\nespecially to help a couple of lads about the age of you. . . .” The reminiscence in his eyes flickered\\nout, and he stood up straight with a chary look. “Now . . . ah . . . I’m not making any accusations,\\nmind, but . . . ah . . . I take it neither of you can . . . ah . . . what I’m getting at is . . . ah . . . what\\nexactly is the nature of your trouble with Tar Valon, if you don’t mind my asking?”\\nRand’s skin prickled as he realized what the man was suggesting. The One Power. “No, no,\\nnothing like that. I swear. There was even an Aes Sedai helping us. Moiraine was. . . .” He bit his\\ntongue, but the innkeeper’s expression never changed.\\n“Glad to hear it. Not that I’ve all that much love for Aes Sedai, but better them than . . . that other\\nthing.” He shook his head slowly. “Too much talk of that kind of thing, with Logain being brought\\nhere. No offense meant, you understand, but . . . well, I had to know, didn’t I?”\\n“No offense,” Rand said. Mat’s murmur could have been anything, but the innkeeper appeared to\\ntake it for the same as Rand had said.\\n“You two look the right sort, and I do believe you were—are—friends of Thom, but it’s hard\\ntimes and stony days. I don’t suppose you can pay? No, I didn’t think so. There’s not enough of\\nanything, and what there is costs the earth, so I’ll give you beds—not the best, but warm and dry—and\\nsomething to eat, and I cannot promise more, however much I’d like.”\\n“Thank you,” Rand said with a quizzical glance at Mat. “It’s more than I expected.” What was\\nthe right sort, and why \\nshould\\n he promise more?\\n“Well, Thom’s a good friend.

Some of the Guards have long\\nmemories, and so does the Queen. No need taking chances.”\\n“Thom had trouble with the Queen?” Rand said incredulously, and the innkeeper laughed.\\n“So he didn’t tell you everything. Don’t know why he should. On the other hand, I don’t know\\nwhy you shouldn’t know, either. Not like it’s a secret, exactly. Do you think every gleeman thinks as\\nmuch of himself as Thom does? Well, come to think of it, I guess they do, but it always seemed to me\\nThom had an extra helping of thinking a lot of himself. He wasn’t always a gleeman, you know,\\nwandering from village to village and sleeping under a hedge as often as not. There was a time Thom\\nMerrilin was Courtbard right here in Caemlyn, and known in every royal court from Tear to\\nMaradon.”\\n“Thom?” Mat said.\\nRand nodded slowly. He could picture Thom at a Queen’s court, with his stately manner and\\ngrand gestures.\\n“That he was,” Master Gill said. “It was not long after Taringail Damodred died that the . . .\\ntrouble about his nephew cropped up. There were some said Thom was, shall we say, closer to the\\nQueen than was proper. But Morgase was a young widow, and Thom was in his prime, then, and the\\nQueen can do as she wishes is the way I look at it. Only she’s always had a temper, has our good\\nMorgase, and he took off without a word when he learned what kind of trouble his nephew was in.\\nThe Queen didn’t much like that. Didn’t like him meddling in Aes Sedai matters, either. Can’t say I\\nthink it was right, either, nephew or no. Anyway, when he came back, he said some words, all right.\\nWords you don’t say to a Queen. Words you don’t say to any woman with Morgase’s spirit. Elaida\\nwas set against him because of his trying to mix in the business with his nephew, and between the\\nQueen’s temper and Elaida’s animosity, Thom left Caemlyn half a step ahead of a trip to prison, if not\\nthe headsman’s axe. As far as I know, the writ still stands.”\\n“If it was a long time ago,” Rand said, “maybe nobody remembers.”\\nMaster Gill shook his head. “Gareth Bryne is Captain-General of the Queen’s Guards. He\\npersonally commanded the Guardsmen Morgase sent to bring Thom back in chains, and I misdoubt\\nhe’ll ever forget returning empty-handed to find Thom had already been back to the Palace and left\\nagain. And the Queen never forgets \\nanything.\\n You ever know a woman who did? My, but Morgase\\nwas in a taking. I’ll swear the whole city walked soft and whispered for a month.

Rand shook his head when he saw the plates, with a few thin slices of gravy-covered\\nbeef, a spoonful of mustard greens, and two potatoes on each. It was a rueful, resigned headshake,\\nthough, not angry. Not enough of anything, the innkeeper had said. Picking up his knife and fork, Rand\\nwondered what would happen when there was nothing left.

It made him shiver.\\nMaster Gill had chosen a table well away from anyone else, and he sat with his back to the\\ncorner, where he could watch the room.

If I’m going to help, I’d best know what I’m getting into.”\\nRand looked at Mat, but Mat was frowning at his plate as if he were mad at the potato he was\\ncutting.

But he did not think it was fair to understate the\\ndanger, either, not fair to pull someone in when they had no idea what they were getting into. Some\\nmen were after him and Mat, and a couple of friends of theirs, too. They appeared where they were\\nleast expected, these men, and they were deadly dangerous and set on killing him and his friends, or\\nworse. Moiraine said some of them were Darkfriends. Thom did not trust Moiraine completely, but\\nhe stayed on with them, he said, because of his nephew. They had been separated during an attack\\nwhile trying to reach Whitebridge, and then, in Whitebridge, Thom died saving them from another\\nattack. And there had been other tries.

Something compelled him to add, “It could bring you trouble,\\nhelping us.”\\nMaster Gill waved it off with a plump hand. “Can’t say as I want trouble, but it wouldn’t be the\\nfirst I’ve seen. No bloody Darkfriend will make me turn my back on Thom’s friends. This friend of\\nyours from up north, now—if she comes to Caemlyn, I’ll hear.

He thought Mat had his hand under his coat,\\nclutching that dagger again.\\n“You just going to lie up here hiding?” he said finally.\\n“I’m tired,” Mat mumbled.\\n“We have questions to ask Master Gill, yet. He might even be able to tell us how to find\\nEgwene, and Perrin. They could be in Caemlyn already if they managed to hang onto their horses.”\\n“They’re dead,” Mat said to the wall.\\nRand hesitated, then gave up. He closed the door softly behind him, hoping Mat really would\\nsleep.\\nDownstairs, however, Master Gill was nowhere to be found, though the sharp look in the cook’s\\neye said she was looking for him, too. For a while Rand sat in the common room, but he found himself\\neyeing every patron who came in, every stranger who could be anyone—or anything—especially in\\nthe moment when he was first silhouetted as a cloaked black shape in the doorway. A Fade in the\\nroom would be like a fox in a chicken coop.\\nA Guardsman entered from the street. The red-uniformed man stopped just inside the door,\\nrunning a cool eye over those in the room who were obviously from outside the city. Rand studied the\\ntabletop when the Guardsman’s eyes fell on him; when he looked up again, the man was gone.\\nThe dark-eyed maid was passing with her arms full of towels. “They do that sometimes,” she\\nsaid in a confiding tone as she went by. “Just to see there’s no trouble. They look after good Queen’s\\nfolk, they do. Nothing for you to worry about.” She giggled.\\nRand shook his head. Nothing for him to worry about. It was not as if the Guardsman would have\\ncome over and demanded to know if he knew Thom Merrilin. He was getting as bad as Mat. He\\nscraped back his chair.\\nAnother maid was checking the oil in the lamps along the wall.\\n“Is there another room where I could sit?” he asked her. He did not want to go back upstairs and\\nshut himself up with Mat’s sullen withdrawal. “Maybe a private dining room that’s not being used?”\\n“There’s the library.” She pointed to a door. “Through there, to your right, at the end of the hall.\\nMight be empty, this hour.”\\n“Thank you. If you see Master Gill, would you tell him Rand al’Thor needs to talk to him if he\\ncan spare a minute?”\\n“I’ll tell him,” she said, then grinned. “Cook wants to talk to him, too.”\\nThe innkeeper was probably hiding, he thought as he turned away from her.\\nWhen he stepped into the room to which she had directed him, he stopped and stared. The\\nshelves must have held three or four hundred books, more than he had ever seen in one place before.\\nClothbound, leatherbound with gilded spines. Only a few had wooden covers.

Ready to apologize for\\nhis rudeness, he turned. He was used to being taller than almost everyone he met, but this time his\\neyes traveled up and up and up, and his mouth fell open. Then he came to the head almost reaching the\\nten-foot ceiling. A nose as broad as the face, so wide it was more a snout than a nose. Eyebrows that\\nhung down like tails, framing pale eyes as big as teacups. Ears that poked up to tufted points through a\\nshaggy, black mane. \\nTrolloc!\\n He let out a yell and tried to back up and draw his sword. His feet got\\ntangled, and he sat down hard, instead.\\n“I wish you humans wouldn’t do that,” rumbled a voice as deep as a drum. The tufted ears\\ntwitched violently, and the voice became sad. “So few of you remember us. It’s our own fault, I\\nsuppose. Not many of us have gone out among men since the Shadow fell on the Ways. That’s . . . oh,\\nsix generations, now. Right after the War of the Hundred Years, it was.” The shaggy head shook and\\nlet out a sigh that would have done credit to a bull. “Too long, too long, and so few to travel and see,\\nit might as well have been none.”\\nRand sat there for a minute with his mouth hanging open, staring up at the apparition in wide-\\ntoed, knee-high boots and a dark blue coat that buttoned from the neck to the waist, then flared out to\\nhis boot tops like a kilt over baggy trousers. In one hand was a book, seeming tiny by comparison,\\nwith a finger broad enough for three marking the place.\\n“I thought you were—” he began, then caught himself. “What are—?” That was not any better.\\nGetting to his feet, he gingerly offered his hand. “My name is Rand al’Thor.”\\nA hand as big as a ham engulfed his; it was accompanied by a formal bow. “Loial, son of Arent\\nson of Halan. Your name sings in my ears, Rand al’Thor.”\\nThat sounded like a ritual greeting to Rand. He returned the bow. “Your name sings in my ears,\\nLoial, son of Arent . . . ah . . . son of Halan.”\\nIt was all a little unreal. He still did not know \\nwhat\\n Loial was. The grip of Loial’s huge fingers\\nwas surprisingly gentle, but he was still relieved to get his hand back in one piece.\\n“You humans are very excitable,” Loial said in that bass rumble. “I had heard all the stories, and\\nread the books, of course, but I didn’t realize. My first day in Caemlyn, I could not believe the uproar.\\nChildren cried, and women screamed, and a mob chased me all the way across the city, waving clubs\\nand knives and torches, and shouting, ‘Trolloc!’ I’m afraid I was almost beginning to get a little upset.\\nThere’s no telling what would have happened if a party of the Queen’s Guards hadn’t come along.”\\n“A lucky thing,” Rand said faintly.\\n“Yes, but even the Guardsmen seemed almost as afraid of me as the others. Four days in\\nCaemlyn now, and I haven’t been able to put my nose outside this inn. Good Master Gill even asked\\nme not to use the common room.” His ears twitched. “Not that he hasn’t been very hospitable, you\\nunderstand. But there was a bit of trouble that first night. All the humans seemed to want to leave at\\nonce. Such screaming and shouting, everyone trying to get through the door at the same time. Some of\\nthem could have been hurt.”\\nRand stared in fascination at those twitching ears.\\n“I’ll tell you, it was not for this I left the \\nstedding.\\n”\\n“You’re an Ogier!” Rand exclaimed. “Wait!

How old are you?” He knew it was rude as soon as he said it, but Loial became defensive\\nrather than offended.\\n“Ninety years,” the Ogier said stiffly. “In only ten more I’ll be able to address the Stump. I think\\nthe Elders should have let me speak, since they were deciding whether I could leave or not. But then\\nthey always worry about anyone of any age going Outside. You humans are so hasty, so erratic.” He\\nblinked and gave a short bow. “Please forgive me. I shouldn’t have said that. But you do fight all the\\ntime, even when there’s no need to.”\\n“That’s all right,” Rand said. He was still trying to take in Loial’s age. Older than old Cenn\\nBuie, and still not old enough to. . . . He sat down in one of the high-backed chairs. Loial took\\nanother, made to hold two; he filled it. Sitting, he was as tall as most men standing. “At least they did\\nlet you go.”\\nLoial looked at the floor, wrinkling his nose and rubbing at it with one thick finger. “Well, as to\\nthat, now. You see, the Stump had not been meeting very long, not even a year, but I could tell from\\nwhat I heard that by the time they reached a decision I would be old enough to go without their\\npermission. I am afraid they’ll say I put a long handle on my axe, but I just . . . left. The Elders always\\nsaid I was too hotheaded, and I fear I’ve proven them right. I wonder if they have realized I’m gone,\\nyet? But I had to go.”\\nRand bit his lip to keep from laughing. If Loial was a hotheaded Ogier, he could imagine what\\nmost Ogier were like. Had not been meeting very long, not even a year? Master al’Vere would just\\nshake his head in wonder; a Village Council meeting that lasted half a day would have everybody\\njumping up and down, even Haral Luhhan. A wave of homesickness swept over him, making it hard to\\nbreathe for memories of Tam, and Egwene, and the Winespring Inn, and Bel Tine on the Green in\\nhappier days. He forced them away.\\n“If you don’t mind my asking,” he said, clearing his throat, “why did you want to go . . . ah,\\nOutside, so much? I wish I’d never left my home, myself.”\\n“Why, to see,” Loial said as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. “I read the books, all\\nthe travelers’ accounts, and it began to burn in me that I had to see, not just read.” His pale eyes\\nbrightened, and his ears stiffened. “I studied every scrap I could find about traveling, about the Ways,\\nand customs in human lands, and the cities we built for you humans after the Breaking of the World.\\nAnd the more I read, the more I knew that I had to go Outside, go to those places we had been, and\\nsee the groves for myself.”\\nRand blinked. “Groves?”\\n“Yes, the groves. The trees. Only a few of the Great Trees, of course, towering to the sky to keep\\nmemories of the \\nstedding\\n fresh.” His chair groaned as he shifted forward, gesturing with his hands,\\none of which still held the book. His eyes were brighter than ever, and his ears almost quivered.\\n“Mostly they used the trees of the land and the place. You cannot make the land go against itself. Not\\nfor long; the land will rebel. You must shape the vision to the land, not the land to the vision. In every\\ngrove was planted every tree that would grow and thrive in that place, each balanced against the next,\\neach placed to complement the others, for the best growing, of course, but also so that the balance\\nwould sing in the eye and the heart. Ah, the books spoke of groves to make Elders weep and laugh at\\nthe same time, groves to remain green in memory forever.”\\n“What about the cities?” Rand asked. Loial gave him a puzzled look. “The cities. The cities the\\nOgier built. Here, for instance. Caemlyn. Ogier built Caemlyn, didn’t you? The stories say so.”\\n“Working with stone. . . .” His shoulders gave a massive shrug. “That was just something\\nlearned in the years after the Breaking, during the Exile, when we were still trying to find the'),\n",

Try as you will—and I have read\\nthat the Ogier who built those cities truly did try—you cannot make stone live. A few still do work\\nwith stone, but only because you humans damage the buildings so often with your wars. There were a\\nhandful of Ogier in . . . ah . . . Cairhien, it’s called now . . . when I passed through. They were from\\nanother \\nstedding,\\n luckily, so they didn’t know about me, but they were still suspicious that I was\\nOutside alone so young. I suppose it’s just as well there was no reason for me to linger there. In any\\ncase, you see, working with stone is just something that was thrust on us by the weaving of the Pattern;\\nthe groves came from the heart.”\\nRand shook his head. Half the stories he had grown up with had just been stood on their heads.\\n“I didn’t know Ogier believed in the Pattern, Loial.”\\n“Of course, we believe. The Wheel of Time weaves the Pattern of the Ages, and lives are the\\nthreads it weaves. No one can tell how the thread of his own life will be woven into the Pattern, or\\nhow the thread of a people will be woven. It gave us the Breaking of the World, and the Exile, and\\nStone, and the Longing, and eventually it gave us back the \\nstedding\\n before we all died. Sometimes I\\nthink the reason you humans are the way you are is because your threads are so short. They must jump\\naround in the weaving. Oh, there, I’ve done it again. The Elders say you humans don’t like to be\\nreminded of how short a time you live. I hope I didn’t hurt your feelings.”\\nRand laughed and shook his head. “Not at all. I suppose it’d be fun to live as long as you do, but\\nI never really thought about it. I guess if I live as long as old Cenn Buie, that’ll be long enough for\\nanybody.”\\n“He is a very old man?”\\nRand just nodded. He was not about to explain that old Cenn Buie was not quite as old as Loial.\\n“Well,” Loial said, “perhaps you humans do have short lives, but you do so much with them,\\nalways jumping around, always so hasty. And you have the whole world to do it in. We Ogier are\\nbound to our \\nstedding.\\n”\\n“You’re Outside.”\\n“For a time, Rand. But I must go back, eventually. This world is yours, yours and your kind’s.\\nThe \\nstedding\\n are mine. There’s too much hurly-burly Outside. And so much is changed from what I\\nread about.”\\n“Well, things do change over the years. Some, anyway.”\\n“Some? Half the cities I read about aren’t even there any longer, and most of the rest are known\\nby different names. You take Cairhien. The city’s proper name is Al’cair’rahienallen, Hill of the\\nGolden Dawn. They don’t even remember, for all of the sunrise on their banners. And the grove there.\\nI doubt if it has been tended since the Trolloc Wars. It’s just another forest, now, where they cut\\nfirewood. The Great Trees are all gone, and no one remembers them. And here? Caemlyn is still\\nCaemlyn, but they let the city grow right over the grove. We’re not a quarter of a mile from the center\\nof it right where we sit—from where the center of it should be. Not a tree of it left. I’ve been to Tear\\nand Illian, too. Different names, and no memories. There’s only pasture for their horses where the\\ngrove was at Tear, and at Illian the grove is the King’s park, where he hunts his deer, and none\\nallowed inside without his permission. It has all changed, Rand. I fear very much that I will find the\\nsame everywhere I go. All the groves gone, all the memories gone, all the dreams dead.”\\n“You can’t give up, Loial. You can’t ever give up. If you give up, you might as well be dead.”\\nRand sank back in his chair as far as he could go, his face turning red. He expected the Ogier to laugh\\nat him, but Loial nodded gravely instead.\\n“Yes, that’s the way of your kind, isn’t it?” The Ogier’s voice changed, as if he were quoting'),\n",

But he still waited, the silence growing uncomfortable for Rand.\\n“The Great Trees,” Rand said finally, just for something to break that silence. “Are they like\\nAvendesora\\n?”\\nLoial sat up sharply; his chair squealed and cracked so loudly Rand thought it was going to come\\napart. “You know better than that. You, of all people.”\\n“Me? How would I know?”\\n“Are you playing a joke on me? Sometimes you Aielmen think the oddest things are funny.”\\n“What? I’m not an Aielman! I’m from the Two Rivers. I never even saw an Aielman!”\\nLoial shook his head, and the tufts on his ears drooped outward. “You see? Everything is\\nchanged, and half of what I know is useless. I hope I did not offend you. I’m sure your Two Rivers is\\na very fine place, wherever it is.”\\n“Somebody told me,” Rand said, “that it was once called Manetheren.

Your pain sings in my heart, Rand al’Thor. We could not come in\\ntime.”\\nLoial bowed where he sat, and Rand bowed back. He suspected Loial would be hurt if he did\\nnot, would think he was rude at the least. He wondered if Loial thought he had the same sort of\\nmemories the Ogier seemed to. The corners of Loial’s mouth and eyes were certainly turned down as\\nif he were sharing the pain of Rand’s loss, just as if the destruction of Manetheren were not something\\nthat happened two thousand years ago, near enough, something that Rand only knew about because of\\nMoiraine’s story.\\nAfter a time Loial sighed. “The Wheel turns,” he said, “and no one knows its turning. But you\\nhave come almost as far from your home as I have. A very considerable distance, as things are now.\\nWhen the Ways were freely open, of course—but that is long past. Tell me, what brings you so far? Is\\nthere something you want to see, too?”\\nRand opened his mouth to say that they had come to see the false Dragon—and he could not say\\nit. Perhaps it was because Loial acted as if he were no older than Rand, ninety years old or no ninety\\nyears old. Maybe for an Ogier ninety years was not any older than he was. It had been a long time\\nsince he had been able to really talk to anyone about what was happening. Always the fear that they\\nmight be Darkfriends, or think he was.

Breathing heavily through his\\nnose, he watched the Ogier warily, hoping he thought he had meant nightmares. The Light knew it all\\nsounded like a nightmare, or enough to give anyone nightmares.

Maybe. . . .\\n“Ta’veren,”\\n Loial said.\\nRand blinked. “What?”\\n“Ta’veren.”\\n Loial rubbed behind a pointed ear with one blunt finger and gave a little shrug.\\n“Elder Haman always said I never listened, but sometimes I did. Sometimes, I listened. You know\\nhow the Pattern is woven, of course?”\\n“I never really thought about it,” he said slowly. “It just is.”\\n“Um, yes, well. Not exactly. You see, the Wheel of Time weaves the Pattern of the Ages, and the\\nthreads it uses are lives. It is not fixed, the Pattern, not always. If a man tries to change the direction\\nof his life and the Pattern has room for it, the Wheel just weaves on and takes it in. There is always\\nroom for small changes, but sometimes the Pattern simply won’t accept a big change, no matter how\\nhard you try. You understand?”\\nRand nodded. “I could live on the farm or in Emond’s Field, and that would be a small change.\\nIf I wanted to be a king, though. . . .” He laughed, and Loial gave a grin that almost split his face in\\ntwo. His teeth were white, and as broad as chisels.\\n“Yes, that’s it. But sometimes the change chooses you, or the Wheel chooses it for you. And\\nsometimes the Wheel bends a life-thread, or several threads, in such a way that all the surrounding\\nthreads are forced to swirl around it, and those force other threads, and those still others, and on and\\non. That first bending to make the Web, that is \\nta’veren,\\n and there is nothing you can do to change it,\\nnot until the Pattern itself changes. The Web—\\nta’maral’ailen,\\n it’s called—can last for weeks, or for\\nyears. It can take in a town, or even the whole Pattern. Artur Hawkwing was \\nta’veren.\\n So was Lews\\nTherin Kinslayer, for that matter, I suppose.” He let out a booming chuckle. “Elder Haman would be\\nproud of me. He always droned on, and the books about traveling were much more interesting, but I\\ndid listen sometimes.”\\n“That’s all very well,” Rand said, “but I don’t see what it has to do with me. I’m a shepherd, not\\nanother Artur Hawkwing. And neither is Mat, or Perrin. It’s just . . . ridiculous.”\\n“I didn’t say you were, but I could almost feel the Pattern swirl just listening to you tell your\\ntale, and I have no Talent there. You are \\nta’veren,\\n all right. You, and maybe your friends, too.” The\\nOgier paused, rubbing the bridge of his broad nose thoughtfully. Finally he nodded to himself as if he\\nhad reached a decision. “I wish to travel with you, Rand.”\\nFor a minute Rand stared, wondering if he had heard correctly. “With me?” he exclaimed when\\nhe could speak. “Didn’t you hear what I said about . . . ?” He eyed the door suddenly. It was shut\\ntight, and thick enough that anyone trying to listen on the other side would hear only a murmur, even\\nwith his ear pressed against the wooden panels. Just the same he went on in a lower voice. “About\\nwho’s chasing me? Anyway, I thought you wanted to go see your trees.”\\n“There is a very fine grove at Tar Valon, and I have been told the Aes Sedai keep it well tended.\\nBesides, it is not just the groves I want to see. Perhaps you are not another Artur Hawkwing, but for a\\ntime, at least, part of the world will shape itself around you, perhaps is even now shaping itself\\naround you. Even Elder Haman would want to see that.”\\nRand hesitated. It would be good to have someone else along. The way Mat was behaving, being\\nwith him was almost like being alone.

Skeletal trees surrounded her, stark and\\nblack in the dim moonlight. The trees and the night made an effective screen for Whatever Moiraine\\nand Lan were doing, not that either of them had paused to let her know what that was. A low “Keep\\nthe horses quiet,” from Lan, and they were gone, leaving her standing like a stableboy. She glanced at\\nthe horses and sighed with exasperation.\\nMandarb blended into the night almost as well as his master’s cloak. The only reason the battle-\\ntrained stallion was letting her get this close was because Lan had handed her the reins himself. He\\nseemed calm enough now, but she remembered all too well the lips drawing back silently when she\\nreached for his bridle without waiting for Lan’s approval. The silence had made the bared teeth seem\\nthat much more dangerous. With a last wary look at the stallion, she turned to peer in the direction the\\nother two had gone, idly stroking her own horse. She gave a startled jump when Aldieb pushed a pale\\nmuzzle under her hand, but after a minute she gave the white mare a pat, too.\\n“No need to take it out on you, I suppose,” she whispered, “just because your mistress is a cold-\\nfaced—” She strained at the darkness again. \\nWhat were they doing?\\nAfter leaving Whitebridge they had ridden through villages that seemed unreal in their normality,\\nordinary market villages that seemed to Nynaeve unconnected to a world that had Fades and Trollocs\\nand Aes Sedai. They had followed the Caemlyn Road, until at last Moiraine sat forward in Aldieb’s\\nsaddle, peering eastward as if she could see the whole length of the great highway, all the many miles\\nto Caemlyn, and see, too, what waited there.\\nEventually the Aes Sedai let out a long breath and settled back. “The Wheel weaves as the\\nWheel wills,” she murmured, “but I cannot believe it weaves an end to hope. I must first take care of\\nthat of which I can be certain. It will be as the Wheel weaves.” And she turned her mare north, off the\\nroad into the forest. One of the boys was in that direction with the coin Moiraine had given him. Lan\\nfollowed.\\nNynaeve gave a long last look at the Caemlyn Road. Few people shared the roadway with them\\nthere, a couple of high-wheeled carts and one empty wagon in the distance, a handful of folk afoot\\nwith their belongings on their backs or piled on pushcarts. Some of those were willing to admit they\\nwere on their way to Caemlyn to see the false Dragon, but most denied it vehemently, especially those\\nwho had come through Whitebridge.

Lan looked back at her frequently, and waved for her to come on, but he\\nkept at Moiraine’s shoulder, and the Aes Sedai had her eyes fixed ahead.\\nOne evening after they left the road, the invisible trail failed. Moiraine, the unflappable\\nMoiraine, suddenly stood up beside the small fire where the tea kettle was boiling, her eyes\\nwidening. “It is gone,” she whispered at the night.\\n“He is . . . ?” Nynaeve could not finish the question. \\nLight, I don’t even know which one it is!\\n“He did not die,” the Aes Sedai said slowly, “but he no longer has the token.” She sat down, her\\nvoice level and her hands steady as she took the kettle off the flames and tossed in a handful of tea.\\n“In the morning we will keep on as we’ve been going.

The hand on her arm\\nappeared to come out of thin air.\\nShe drew a shuddering breath. She expected him to comment on how easily he had come on her\\nunaware, but instead he turned to dig into his saddlebags. “You are needed,” he said, and knelt to\\nfasten hobbles on the horses.\\nAs soon as the horses were secured, he straightened, grasped her hand, and headed off into the\\nnight again. His dark hair fit into the night almost as well as his cloak, and he made even less noise\\nthan she did. Grudgingly she had to admit that she could never have followed him through the\\ndarkness without his grip as a guide. She was not certain she could pull loose if he did not want to\\nrelease her, anyway; he had very strong hands.\\nAs they came up on a small rise, barely enough to be called a hill, he sank to one knee, pulling\\nher down beside him. It took her a moment to see that Moiraine was there, too. Unmoving, the Aes\\nSedai could have passed for a shadow in her dark cloak. Lan gestured down the hillside to a large\\nclearing in the trees.\\nNynaeve frowned in the dim moonlight, then suddenly smiled in understanding. Those pale blurs\\nwere tents in regular rows, a darkened encampment.\\n“Whitecloaks,” Lan whispered, “two hundred of them, maybe more. There’s good water down\\nthere. And the lad we’re after.”\\n“In the camp?” She felt, more than saw, Lan nod.\\n“In the middle of it. Moiraine can point right to him. I went close enough to see he’s under\\nguard.”\\n“A prisoner?” Nynaeve said. “Why?”'),\n",

Of course! What kind of chance?”\\nHe pointed into the darkness again, beyond the tents. This time she could make out nothing but\\nshadows. “Their horse-lines. If the picket-ropes are cut, not all the way through, but enough so they’ll\\nbreak when Moiraine creates a diversion, the Whitecloaks will be too busy chasing their own horses\\nto come after us.

Stalking rabbits was one thing; guards, though, with spears and\\nswords. . . . \\nSo he thinks I’m good, does he?\\n “I’ll do it.”\\nLan nodded again, as if he had expected no less. “One other thing. There are wolves about,\\ntonight. I saw two, and if I saw that many, there are probably more.” He paused, and though his voice\\ndid not change she had the feeling he was puzzled. “It was almost as if they wanted me to see them.\\nAnyway, they shouldn’t bother you. Wolves usually stay away from people.”\\n“I wouldn’t have known that,” she said sweetly. “I only grew up around shepherds.” He grunted,\\nand she smiled into the darkness.\\n“We’ll do it now, then,” he said.\\nHer smile faded as she peered down at the camp full of armed men. Two hundred men with\\nspears and swords and. . . . Before she could reconsider, she eased her knife in its sheath and started\\nto slip away.

She was not about to let the\\nAes Sedai know the grip had hurt. But Moiraine turned back to watching the camp below as soon as\\nshe let go. And the Warder was gone, Nynaeve realized with a start. She had not heard him leave.\\nLight blind the bloody man!\\n Quickly she tied her skirts up to give her legs freedom, and hurried into\\nthe night.\\nAfter that first rush, with fallen branches cracking under her feet, she slowed down, glad there\\nwas no one there to see her blush. The idea was to be quiet, and she was not in any kind of\\ncompetition with the Warder. \\nOh, no?\\nShe shook off the thought and concentrated on making her way through the dark woods. It was not\\nhard in and of itself; the faint light of the waning moon was more than enough for anyone who had\\nbeen taught by her father, and the ground had a slow, easy roll. But the trees, bare and stark against\\nthe night sky, constantly reminded her that this was no childhood game, and the keening wind sounded\\nall too much like Trolloc horns.

Almost\\nholding her breath, she got down on her stomach and crawled upwind, toward the smell.\\nShe was nearly on the guards before she saw them, marching toward her out of the night, white\\ncloaks flapping in the wind and almost shining in the moonlight. They might as well have carried\\ntorches; torchlight could not have made them much more visible. She froze, trying to make herself a\\npart of the ground. Nearly in front of her, not ten paces away, they marched to a halt with a stomp of\\nfeet, facing each other, spears shouldered. Just beyond them she could make out shadows that had to\\nbe the horses. The stable smell, horse and manure, was strong.\\n“All is well with the night,” one white-cloaked shape announced. “The Light illumine us, and\\nprotect us from the Shadow.”\\n“All is well with the night,” the other replied. “The Light illumine us, and protect us from the\\nShadow.”\\nWith that they turned and marched off into the darkness again.\\nNynaeve waited, counting to herself while they made their circuit twice. Each time they took\\nexactly the same count, and each time they rigidly repeated the same formula, not a word more or\\nless. Neither so much as glanced to one side; they stared straight ahead as they marched up, then\\nmarched away. She wondered if they would have noticed her even if she had been standing up.\\nBefore the night swallowed the pale swirls of their cloaks a third time, she was already on her\\nfeet, running in a crouch toward the horses. As she came close, she slowed so as not to startle the\\nanimals. The Whitecloak guards might not see what was not shoved under their noses, but they would\\ncertainly investigate if the horses suddenly began whickering.\\nThe horses along the picket-lines—there was more than one row—were barely realized masses\\nin the darkness, heads down. Occasionally one snorted or stamped a foot in its sleep. In the dim\\nmoonlight she was nearly on the endpost of the picket-line before she saw it. She reached for the\\npicket-line, and froze when the nearest horse raised its head and looked at her. Its single lead-rein\\nwas tied in a big loop around the thumb-thick line that ended at the post. \\nOne whinny.\\n Her heart tried\\nto pound its way out of her chest, sounding loud enough to bring the guards.\\nNever taking her eyes off the horse, she sliced at the picket-rope, feeling in front of her blade to\\nsee how far she had cut. The horse tossed its head, and her breath went cold. \\nJust one whinny.\\nOnly a few thin strands of hemp remained whole under her fingers. Slowly she headed toward\\nthe next line, watching the horse until she could no longer see if it was looking at her or not, then\\ndrew a ragged breath. If they were all like that, she did not think she would last.\\nAt the next picket-rope, though, and the next, and the next, the horses remained asleep, even\\nwhen she cut her thumb and bit off a yelp. Sucking the cut, she looked warily back the way she had\\ncome. Upwind as she was, she could no longer hear the guards make their exchange, but they might\\nhave heard her if they were in the right place. If they were coming to see what the noise had been, the\\nwind would keep her from hearing them until they were right on top of her. \\nTime to go. With four\\nhorses out of five running loose, they won’t be chasing anyone.\\nBut she did not move. She could imagine Lan’s eyes when he heard what she had done. There\\nwould be no accusation in them; her reasoning was sound, and he would not expect any more of her.\\nShe was a Wisdom, not a bloody great invincible Warder who could make himself all but invisible.\\nJaw set, she moved to the last picket-line. The first horse on it was Bela.\\nThere was no mistaking that squat, shaggy shape; for there to be another horse like that, here and\\nnow, was too big a coincidence.

The Children did not think prisoners needed blankets, or shelter.\\nEspecially not dangerous Darkfriends.\\nEgwene lay huddled against his back for warmth, sleeping the deep sleep of exhaustion. She\\nnever even murmured at his shifting. The sun was long hours below the horizon, and he ached from\\nhead to foot after a day walking behind a horse with a halter around his neck, but sleep would not\\ncome for him.\\nThe column did not move that fast. With most of their remounts lost to the wolves in the\\nstedding,\\n the Whitecloaks could not push on as hard as they wanted; the delay was another thing they\\nheld against the Emond’s Fielders. The sinuous double line did move steadily, though—Lord\\nBornhald meant to reach Caemlyn in time for Whatever it was—and always in the back of Perrin’s\\nmind was the fear that if he fell the Whitecloak holding his leash would not stop, no matter Lord\\nCaptain Bornhald’s orders to keep them alive for the Questioners in Amador. He knew he could not\\nsave himself if that happened; the only times they freed his hands were when he was fed and for visits\\nto the latrine pit.

The man stopped to speak with the\\nguards, who answered respectfully. Perrin could not hear what was said, but he recognized the tall,\\ngaunt shape.\\nHe squinted as the lantern was held close to his face. Byar had Perrin’s axe in his other hand; he\\nhad appropriated the weapon as his own. At least, Perrin never saw him without it.\\n“Wake up,” Byar said emotionlessly, as if he thought Perrin slept with his head raised. He\\naccompanied the words with a heavy kick in the ribs.\\nPerrin gave a grunt through gritted teeth. His sides were a mass of bruises already from Byar’s\\nboots.\\n“I said, wake up.” The foot went back again, and Perrin spoke quickly.\\n“I’m awake.” You had to acknowledge what Byar said, or he found ways to get your attention.\\nByar set the lantern on the ground and bent to check his bonds. The man jerked roughly at his\\nwrist, twisting his arms in their sockets. Finding those knots still as tight as he had left them, Byar\\npulled at his ankle rope, scraping him across the rocky ground. The man looked too skeletal to have\\nany strength, but Perrin might as well have been a child. It was a nightly routine.\\nAs Byar straightened, Perrin saw that Egwene was still asleep. “Wake up!” he shouted.\\n“Egwene! Wake up!”\\n“Wha . . . ? What?” Egwene’s voice was frightened and still thick with sleep. She lifted her\\nhead, blinking in the lantern light.\\nByar gave no sign of disappointment at not being able to kick her awake; he never did. He just\\njerked at her ropes the same way he had Perrin’s, ignoring her groans.

Sometimes such a denial brought a lecture delivered in a grating near monotone,\\non confession and repentance, leading into a description of the Questioners’ methods of obtaining\\nthem. Sometimes it brought the lecture and a kick. To his surprise, this time Byar ignored it.\\nInstead the man squatted in front of him, all angles and sunken hollows, with the axe across his\\nknees. The golden sun on his cloak’s left breast, and the two golden stars beneath it, glittered in the\\nlantern light. Taking off his helmet, he set it beside the lantern. For a change there was something\\nbesides disdain or hatred on his face, something intent and unreadable. He rested his arms on the\\naxehandle and studied Perrin silently. Perrin tried not to shift under that hollow-eyed stare.\\n“You are slowing us down, Darkfriend, you and your wolves.

If you escaped,\\nwe would not have time to track you down. We don’t have an hour to spare if we are to reach\\nCaemlyn in time. If you frayed your ropes on a sharp rock, say, and vanished into the night, the Lord\\nCaptain’s problem would be solved.” Never taking his gaze from Perrin, he reached under his cloak\\nand tossed something on the ground.\\nAutomatically Perrin’s eyes followed it.

A\\nsplit rock with a sharp edge.\\n“Just idle speculation,” Byar said. “Your guards tonight also speculate.”\\nPerrin’s mouth was suddenly dry. \\nThink it through!

Letting suspected Darkfriends escape? There was no use trying that way; he did not know\\nenough. Byar was the only Whitecloak who would talk to them, aside from Lord Captain Bornhald,\\nand neither was exactly free with information. Another way. If Byar wanted them to escape, why not\\nsimply cut their bonds? If Byar wanted them to escape? Byar, who was convinced to his marrow that\\nthey were Darkfriends.

If he changed his mind about the rock, would he dare risk\\nleaving them alive to talk? Ropes could be frayed after the people wearing them were dead, even if it\\nmade for risk of discovery.

Byar’s eyes widened as\\nthe force of his blow carried him off balance, as the Warder struck with hands and feet in rapid\\nsuccession, so quick that Perrin was not sure what he had just seen. What he was sure of was Byar\\ncollapsing like a puppet. Before the falling Whitecloak had finished settling to the ground, the Warder\\nwas on his knees extinguishing the lantern.\\nIn the sudden return to darkness, Perrin stared blindly. Lan seemed to have vanished again.\\n“Is it really . . . ?” Egwene gave a stifled sob. “We thought you were dead. We thought you were\\nall dead.”\\n“Not yet.” The Warder’s deep whisper was tinged with amusement.\\nHands touched Perrin, found his bonds.

Is he . . . ?”\\n“No,” Lan’s voice answered quietly from the darkness. “I do not kill unless I mean to. But he\\nwon’t bother anyone for a while. Stop asking questions and get a pair of their cloaks. We do not have\\nmuch time.”\\nPerrin crawled to where Byar lay. It took an effort to touch the man, and when he felt the\\nWhitecloak’s chest rising and falling he almost jerked his hands away. His skin crawled as he made\\nhimself unfasten the white cloak and pull it off. Despite what Lan said, he could imagine the skull-\\nfaced man suddenly rearing up. Hastily he fumbled around till he found his axe, then crawled to\\nanother guard. It seemed strange, at first, that he felt no reluctance to touch this unconscious man, but\\nthe reason came to him. All the Whitecloaks hated him, but that was a human emotion. Byar felt\\nnothing beyond that he should die; there was no hate in it, no emotion at all.\\nGathering the two cloaks in his arms, he turned—and panic grabbed him.

He made his own cloak into a bundle to carry, and swung the white cloak around his\\nshoulders in its place. He felt a prickle as it settled around his shoulders, a stab of worry between his\\nshoulder blades. Was it Byar’s cloak he had ended up with?

Whitecloaks\\nlooked at them, wild-eyed, as they passed. A few shouted at them, the shouts lost in the pounding from\\nthe heavens, but with their white cloaks gathered around them no one tried to stop them. Through the\\ntents, out of the camp and into the night, and no one raised a hand against them.\\nThe ground turned uneven under Perrin’s feet, and brush slapped at him as he let himself be\\ndrawn along. The lightning flickered fitfully and was gone. Echoes of thunder rolled across the sky\\nbefore they, too, faded away. Perrin looked over his shoulder. A handful of fires burned back there,\\namong the tents. Some of the lightning must have struck home, or perhaps men had knocked over\\nlamps in their panic. Men still shouted, voices tiny in the night, trying to restore order, to find out\\nwhat had happened. The land began to slope upwards, and tents and fires and shouting were left\\nbehind.\\nSuddenly he almost trod on Egwene’s heels as Lan stopped. Ahead in the moonlight stood three\\nhorses.\\nA shadow stirred, and Moiraine’s voice came, weighted with irritation. “Nynaeve has not\\nreturned. I fear that young woman has done something foolish.” Lan spun on his heel as if to return the\\nway they had come, but a single whip-crack word from Moiraine halted him. “No!” He stood looking\\nat her sideways, only his face and hands truly visible, and they but dimly shadowed blurs. She went\\non in a gentler tone; gentler but no less firm. “Some things are more important than others. You know\\nthat.” The Warder did not move, and her voice hardened again. “Remember your oaths, al’Lan\\nMandragoran, Lord of the Seven Towers! What of the oath of a Diademed Battle Lord of the\\nMalkieri?”'),\n",

Egwene was murmuring, but he could not take his eyes off\\nthe tableau in front of him, Lan standing like a wolf from Dapple’s pack, a wolf at bay before the\\ndiminutive Aes Sedai and vainly seeking escape from doom.\\nThe frozen scene was broken by a crash of breaking branches in the woods. In two long strides\\nLan was between Moiraine and the sound, the pale moonlight rippling along his sword. To the\\ncrackle and snap of underbrush a pair of horses burst from the trees, one with a rider.\\n“Bela!” Egwene exclaimed at the same time that Nynaeve said from the shaggy mare’s back, “I\\nalmost didn’t find you again. Egwene! Thank the Light you’re alive!”\\nShe slid down off Bela, but as she started toward the Emond’s Fielders Lan caught her arm and\\nshe stopped short, staring up at him.\\n“We must go, Lan,” Moiraine said, once more sounding unruffled, and the Warder released his\\ngrip.\\nNynaeve rubbed her arm as she hurried to hug Egwene, but Perrin thought he heard her give a\\nlow laugh, too. It puzzled him because he did not think it had anything to do with her happiness at\\nseeing them again.\\n“Where are Rand and Mat?” he asked.\\n“Elsewhere,” Moiraine replied, and Nynaeve muttered something in a sharp tone that made\\nEgwene gasp. Perrin blinked; he had caught the edge of a wagoneer’s oath, and a coarse one. “The\\nLight send they are well,” the Aes Sedai went on as if she had not noticed.\\n“We will none of us be well,” Lan said, “if the Whitecloaks find us. Change your cloaks, and get\\nmounted.”\\nPerrin scrambled up onto the horse Nynaeve had brought behind Bela. The lack of a saddle did\\nnot hamper him; he did not ride often at home, but when he did it was more likely bareback than not.\\nHe still carried the white cloak, now rolled up and tied to his belt. The Warder said they must leave\\nno more traces for the Children to find than they could help. He still thought he could smell Byar on it.\\nAs they started out, the Warder leading on his tall black stallion, Perrin felt Dapple’s touch on\\nhis mind once more. \\nOne day again.\\n More a feeling than words, it sighed with the promise of a\\nmeeting foreordained, with anticipation of what was to come, with resignation to what was to come,\\nall streaked in layers. He tried to ask when and why, fumbling in haste and sudden fear. The trace of\\nthe wolves grew fainter, fading. His frantic questions brought only the same heavy-laden answer. \\nOne\\nday again.\\n It hung haunting in his mind long after awareness of the wolves winked out.\\nLan pressed southward slowly but steadily. The night-draped wilderness, all rolling ground and\\nunderbrush hidden until it was underfoot, shadowed trees thick against the sky, allowed no great\\nspeed in any case. Twice the Warder left them, riding back toward the slivered moon, he and\\nMandarb becoming one with the night behind. Both times he returned to report no sign of pursuit.\\nEgwene stayed close beside Nynaeve. Soft-spoken scraps of excited talk floated back to Perrin.\\nThose two were as buoyed up as if they had found home again. He hung back at the tail of their little\\ncolumn. Sometimes the Wisdom turned in her saddle to look back at him, and each time he gave her a\\nwave, as if to say that he was all right, and stayed where he was. He had a lot to think about, though\\nhe could not get any of it straight in his head. \\nWhat was to come. What\\n was \\nto come?\\nPerrin thought it could not be much short of dawn when Moiraine finally called a halt. Lan found\\na gully where he could build a fire hidden within a hollow in one of the banks.\\nFinally they were allowed to rid themselves of the white cloaks, burying them in a hole dug near\\nthe fire. As he was about to toss in the cloak he had used, the embroidered golden sun on the breast\\ncaught his eye, and the two golden stars beneath. He dropped the cloak as if it stung and walked'),\n",

That I promise.”\\nThey made a quiet meal on bread and cheese and hot tea. Even Egwene’s enthusiasm succumbed\\nto weariness. The Wisdom produced an ointment from her bag for the weals the ropes had left on\\nEgwene’s wrists, and a different one for her other bruises. When she came to where Perrin sat on the\\nedge of the firelight, he did not look up.\\nShe stood looking at him silently for a time, then squatted with her bag beside her, saying\\nbriskly, “Take your coat and shirt off, Perrin. They tell me one of the Whitecloaks took a dislike to\\nyou.”\\nHe complied slowly, still half lost in Dapple’s message, until Nynaeve gasped. Startled, he\\nstared at her, then at his own bare chest. It was a mass of color, the newer, purple blotches overlaying\\nolder ones faded into shades of brown and yellow. Only thick slabs of muscle earned by hours at\\nMaster Luhhan’s forge had saved him from broken ribs. With his mind filled by the wolves, he had\\nmanaged to forget the pain, but he was reminded of it now, and it came back gladly. Involuntarily he\\ntook a deep breath, and clamped his lips on a groan.\\n“How could he have disliked you so much?” Nynaeve asked wonderingly.\\nI\\n killed \\ntwo men.\\n Aloud, he said, “I don’t know.”\\nShe rummaged in her bag, and he flinched when she began spreading a greasy ointment over his\\nbruises. “Ground ivy, five-finger, and sunburst root,” she said.\\nIt was hot and cold at the same time, making him shiver while he broke into a sweat, but he did\\nnot protest. He had had experience of Nynaeve’s ointments and poultices before. As her fingers gently\\nrubbed the mixture in, the heat and cold vanished, taking the pain with them. The purple splotches\\nfaded to brown, and the brown and yellow paled, some disappearing altogether. Experimentally, he\\ntook a deep breath; there was barely a twinge.\\n“You look surprised,” Nynaeve said. She looked a little surprised herself, and strangely\\nfrightened. “Next time, you can go to \\nher.\\n”\\n“Not surprised,” he said soothingly, “just glad.” Sometimes Nynaeve’s ointments worked fast\\nand sometimes slow, but they always worked. “What. . . what happened to Rand and Mat?”\\nNynaeve began stuffing her vials and pots back into her bag, jamming each one in as if she were\\nthrusting it through a barrier. “ \\nShe\\n says they’re all right. \\nShe\\n says we’ll find them. In Caemlyn, \\nshe\\nsays. \\nShe\\n says it’s too important for us not to, Whatever \\nthat\\n means. \\nShe\\n says a great many things.”\\nPerrin grinned in spite of himself. Whatever else had changed, the Wisdom was still herself, and\\nshe and the Aes Sedai were still far from fast friends.\\nAbruptly Nynaeve stiffened, staring at his face. Dropping her bag, she pressed the backs of her\\nhands to his cheeks and forehead. He tried to pull back, but she caught his head in both hands and\\nthumbed back his eyelids, peering into his eyes and muttering to herself. Despite her small size she\\nheld his face easily; it was never easy to get away from Nynaeve when she did not want you to.\\n“I don’t understand,” she said finally, releasing him and settling back to sit on her heels. “If it\\nwas yelloweye fever, you wouldn’t be able to stand. But you don’t have any fever, and the whites of\\nyour eyes aren’t yellowed, just the irises.”\\n“Yellow?” Moiraine said, and Perrin and Nynaeve both jumped where they sat. The Aes Sedai’s'),\n",

He jerked away, prickling. The two women were\\nhandling him as if he were a child. “I said it isn’t anything.”\\n“There was no foretelling this.” Moiraine spoke as if to herself. Her eyes seemed to look at\\nsomething beyond him. “Something ordained to be woven, or a change in the Pattern? If a change, by\\nwhat hand? The Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills. It must be that.”\\n“Do you know what it is?” Nynaeve asked reluctantly, then hesitated. “Can you do something for\\nhim? Your Healing?” The request for aid, the admission that she could do nothing, came out of her as\\nif dragged.\\nPerrin glared at both the women. “If you’re going to talk about me, talk to me. I’m sitting right\\nhere.” Neither looked at him.\\n“Healing?” Moiraine smiled. “Healing can do nothing about this. It is not an illness, and it will\\nnot. . . .” She hesitated briefly. She did glance at Perrin, then, a quick look that regretted many things.\\nThe look did not include him, though, and he muttered sourly as she turned back to Nynaeve. “I was\\ngoing to say it will not harm him, but who can say what the end will be? At least I can say it will not\\nharm him directly.”\\nNynaeve stood, dusting off her knees, and confronted the Aes Sedai eye to eye. “That’s not good\\nenough. If there’s something wrong with—”\\n“What is, is. What is woven already is past changing.” Moiraine turned away abruptly. “We\\nmust sleep while we can and leave at first light. If the Dark One’s hand grows too strong. . . . We\\nmust reach Caemlyn quickly.”\\nAngrily, Nynaeve snatched up her bag and stalked off before Perrin could speak. He started to\\ngrowl an oath, but a thought hit him like a blow and he sat there gaping silently. Moiraine knew. The\\nAes Sedai knew about the wolves. And she thought it could be the Dark One’s doing. A shiver ran\\nthrough him. Hastily he shrugged back into his shirt, tucking it in awkwardly, and pulled his coat and\\ncloak back on. The clothing did not help very much; he felt chilled right down to his bones, his\\nmarrow like frozen jelly.\\nLan dropped to the ground cross-legged, tossing back his cloak. Perrin was glad of that. It was\\nunpleasant, looking at the Warder and having his eyes slide past.\\nFor a long moment they simply stared at one another. The hard planes of the Warder’s face were\\nunreadable, but in his eyes Perrin thought he saw . . . something. Sympathy? Curiosity? Both?\\n“You know?” he said, and Lan nodded.\\n“I know some, not all. Did it just come to you, or did you meet a guide, an intermediary?”\\n“There was a man,” Perrin said slowly. \\nHe knows, but does he think the same as Moiraine?\\n“He said his name was Elyas. Elyas Machera.” Lan drew a deep breath, and Perrin looked at him\\nsharply. “You know him?”\\n“I knew him. He taught me much, about the Blight, and about this.” Lan touched his sword hilt.\\n“He was a Warder, before . . . before what happened. The Red Ajah. . . .” He glanced to where\\nMoiraine was, lying before the fire.\\nIt was the first time Perrin could remember any uncertainty in the Warder. At Shadar Logoth Lan\\nhad been sure and strong, and when he was facing Fades and Trollocs. He was not afraid now—\\nPerrin was convinced of that—but he was wary, as if he might say too much. As if what he said could\\nbe dangerous.'),\n",

The Whitecloaks said they killed him, but Dapple—” Perrin glanced at the Warder\\nuncomfortably. “I don’t know.” Lan seemed to accept that he did not, reluctantly, and it emboldened\\nhim to go on. “This communicating with the wolves. Moiraine seems to think it’s something the . . .\\nsomething the Dark One did. It isn’t, is it?” He would not believe Elyas was a Darkfriend.\\nBut Lan hesitated, and sweat started on Perrin’s face, chill beads made colder by the night. They\\nwere sliding down his cheeks by the time the Warder spoke.\\n“Not in itself, no. Some believe it is, but they are wrong; it was old and lost long before the\\nDark One was found. But what of the chance involved, blacksmith? Sometimes the Pattern has a\\nrandomness to it—to our eyes, at least—but what chance that you should meet a man who could guide\\nyou in this thing, and you one who could follow the guiding? The Pattern is forming a Great Web,\\nwhat some call the Lace of Ages, and you lads are central to it. I don’t think there is much chance left\\nin your lives, now. Have you been chosen out, then? And if so, by the Light, or by the Shadow?”\\n“The Dark One can’t touch us unless we name him.” Immediately Perrin thought of the dreams of\\nBa’alzamon, the dreams that were more than dreams. He scrubbed the sweat off his face. “He can’t.”\\n“Rock-hard stubborn,” the Warder mused. “Maybe stubborn enough to save yourself, in the end.\\nRemember the times we live in, blacksmith. Remember what Moiraine Sedai told you. In these times\\nmany things are dissolving, and breaking apart. Old barriers weaken, old walls crumble. The barriers\\nbetween what is and what was, between what is and what will be.” His voice turned grim. “The\\nwalls of the Dark One’s prison. This may be the end of an Age. We may see a new Age born before\\nwe die. Or perhaps it is the end of Ages, the end of time itself. The end of the world.” Suddenly he\\ngrinned, but his grin was as dark as a scowl; his eyes sparkled merrily, laughing at the foot of the\\ngallows. “But that’s not for us to worry about, eh, blacksmith? We’ll fight the Shadow as long as we\\nhave breath, and if it overruns us, we’ll go under biting and clawing. You Two Rivers folk are too\\nstubborn to surrender. Don’t you worry whether the Dark One has stirred in your life. You are back\\namong friends, now. Remember, the Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills, and even the Dark One cannot\\nchange that, not with Moiraine to watch over you. But we had better find your friends soon.”\\n“What do you mean?”\\n“They have no Aes Sedai touching the True Source to protect them. Blacksmith, perhaps the\\nwalls have weakened enough for the Dark One himself to touch events. Not with a free hand, or we’d\\nbe done already, but maybe tiny shiftings in the threads. A chance turning of one corner instead of\\nanother, a chance meeting, a chance word, or what seems like chance, and they could be so far under\\nthe Shadow not even Moiraine could bring them back.”\\n“We have to find them,” Perrin said, and the Warder gave a grunt of a laugh.\\n“What have I been saying?

Just you pray we find them there.”\\n“But Moiraine . . . she can find them anywhere, can’t she? She says she can.”\\n“But can she find them in time?

Not only were their swords wrapped in white tied with red, they\\nwore white armbands and white cockades on their hats.\\nHe had not been in Caemlyn long before learning that red wrappings on a sword, or a red\\narmband or cockade, meant support for Queen Morgase.

The Whitecloak barely caught himself and started an angry oath at the\\nman who had bumped him when another man staggered him with a deliberate, aimed shoulder. Before\\nmatters could go any further the Whitecloak’s companions pulled him over to the side of the street to\\nwhere they could shelter in a doorway.

It was widely believed the Whitecloaks\\nsupported those who opposed the Queen and her Aes Sedai advisor, but that made no difference. Men\\nwere doing things of which they had never before thought. Jostling a Whitecloak, today. Tomorrow,\\nperhaps pulling down a Queen? Suddenly he wished there were a few more men close to him\\nshowing red; jostled by white cockades and armbands, he abruptly felt very alone.\\nThe Whitecloaks noticed him looking at them and stared back as if meeting a challenge.

And all those curving streets made it impossible to see very far ahead.\\nAbruptly he was swept around a bend, and there was the Palace. The streets, even following the\\nnatural contours of the land, had been laid out to spiral in on this—this gleeman’s tale of pale spires\\nand golden domes and intricate stonework traceries, with the banner of Andor waving from every\\nprominence, a centerpiece for which all the other vistas had been designed. It seemed more sculpted\\nby an artist than simply built like ordinary buildings.\\nThat glimpse showed him he would get no nearer. No one was being allowed close to the\\nPalace. Queen’s Guards made scarlet ranks ten deep flanking the Palace gates. Along the tops of the\\nwhite walls, on high balconies and towers, more Guards stood rigidly straight, bows precisely\\nslanted across breastplated chests. They, too, looked like something out of a gleeman’s tale, a guard\\nof honor, but Rand did not believe that was why they were there. The clamoring crowd lining the\\nstreets was almost solid with white-wrapped swords, white armbands, and white cockades. Only\\nhere and there was the white wall broken by a knot of red. The red-uniformed guards seemed a thin\\nbarrier against all that white.\\nGiving up on making his way closer to the Palace, he sought a place where he could use his\\nheight to advantage. He did not have to be in the front row to see everything. The crowd shifted\\nconstantly, people shoving to get nearer the front, people hurrying off to what they thought was a\\nbetter vantage point. In one of those shifts he found himself only three people from the open street, and\\nall in front of him were shorter than he, including the pikemen. Almost everyone was. People\\ncrowded against him from both sides, sweating from the press of so many bodies. Those behind him\\nmuttered about not being able to see, and tried to wriggle past. He stood his ground, making an\\nimpervious wall with those to either side. He was content. When the false Dragon passed by, he\\nwould be close enough to see the man’s face clearly.\\nAcross the street and down toward the gates to the New City, a ripple passed through the tight-\\npacked crowd; around the curve, an eddy of people was drawing back to let something go by. It was\\nnot like the clear space that followed Whitecloaks on any day but today. These people jerked\\nthemselves back with startled glances that became grimaces of distaste. Pressing themselves out of\\nthe way, they turned their faces from Whatever it was, but watched out of the corners of their eyes\\nuntil it was past.\\nOther eyes around him noted the disturbance, too. Keyed for the coming of the Dragon but with\\nnothing to do now but wait, the crowd found anything at all worthy of comment. He heard speculation\\nranging from an Aes Sedai to Logain himself, and a few coarser suggestions that brought rough\\nlaughter from the men and disdainful sniffs from the women.\\nThe ripple meandered through the crowd, drawing closer to the edge of the street as it came. No'),\n",

Finally, directly across from Rand,\\nthe crowd bulged into the street, pushing aside red-cloaked pikemen who struggled to shove them\\nback, and broke open. The stooped shape that shuffled hesitantly out into the open looked more like a\\npile of filthy rags than a man. Rand heard murmurs of disgust around him.\\nThe ragged man paused on the far edge of the street. His cowl, torn and stiff with dirt, swung\\nback and forth as if searching for something, or listening. Abruptly he gave a wordless cry and flung\\nout a dirty claw of a hand, pointing straight at Rand. Immediately he began to scuttle across the street\\nlike a bug.\\nThe beggar.\\n Whatever ill chance had led the man to find him like this, Rand was suddenly sure\\nthat, Darkfriend or not, he did not want to meet him face-to-face. He could feel the beggar’s eyes, like\\ngreasy water on his skin. Especially he did not want the man close to him here, surrounded by people\\nbalanced on the brink of violence. The same voices that had laughed before now cursed him as he\\npushed his way back, away from the street.\\nHe hurried, knowing the densely packed mass through which he had to shove and wriggle would\\ngive way before the filthy man. Struggling to force a path through the crowd, he staggered and almost\\nfell when he abruptly broke free. Flailing his arms to keep his balance he turned the stagger into a run.\\nPeople pointed at him; he was the only one not pressing the other way, and running at that. Shouts\\nfollowed him. His cloak flapped behind him, exposing his red-clad sword. When he realized that, he\\nran faster. A lone supporter of the Queen, running, could well spark a white-cockaded mob to pursuit,\\neven today. He ran, letting his long legs eat paving stones. Not until the shouts were left far behind\\ndid he allow himself to collapse against a wall, panting.\\nHe did not know where he was, except that he was still within the Inner City. He could not\\nremember how many twists and turns he had taken along those curving streets. Poised to run again, he\\nlooked back the way he had come. Only one person moved on the street, a woman walking placidly\\nalong with her shopping basket. Almost everyone in the city was gathered for a glimpse of the false\\nDragon. \\nHe can’t have followed me. I must have left him behind.\\nThe beggar would not give up; he was sure of it, though he could not say why. That ragged shape\\nwould be working its way through the crowds at that very minute, searching, and if Rand returned to\\nsee Logain he ran the risk of a meeting. For a moment he considered going back to The Queen’s\\nBlessing, but he was sure he would never get another chance to see a Queen, and he hoped he would\\nnever have another to see a false Dragon. There seemed to be something cowardly in letting a bent\\nbeggar, even a Darkfriend, chase him into hiding.\\nHe looked around, considering. The way the Inner City was laid out, buildings were kept low, if\\nthere were buildings at all, so that someone standing at a particular spot would have nothing to\\ninterrupt the planned view. There had to be places from where he could see the procession pass with\\nthe false Dragon. Even if he could not see the Queen, he could see Logain. Suddenly determined, he\\nset off.\\nIn the next hour he found several such places, every last one already packed cheek-to-cheek with\\npeople avoiding the crush along the procession route. They were a solid front of white cockades and\\narmbands. No red at all. Thinking what the sight of his sword might do in a crowd like that, he\\nslipped away carefully, and quickly.\\nShouting floated up from the New City, cries and the blaring of trumpets, the martial beat of\\ndrums. Logain and his escort were already in Caemlyn, already on their way to the Palace.\\nDispirited, he wandered the all but empty streets, still halfheartedly hoping to find some way to'),\n",

His eyes fell on the slope, bare of buildings, rising above the street where he was\\nwalking. In a normal spring the slope would be an expanse of flowers and grass, but now it was\\nbrown all the way to the high wall along its crest, a wall over which the tops of trees were visible.\\nThis part of the street had not been designed for any grand view, but just ahead, over the\\nrooftops, he could see some of the Palace spires, topped by White Lion banners fluttering in the wind.\\nHe was not sure exactly where the curve of the street ran after it rounded the hill beyond his sight, but\\nhe suddenly had a thought about that hilltop wall.\\nThe drums and trumpets were drawing nearer, the shouting growing louder. Anxiously he\\nscrambled up the slope. It was not meant to be climbed, but he dug his boots into the dead sod and\\npulled himself up using leafless shrubs as handholds. Panting as much with desire as effort, he\\nscrambled the last yards to the wall. It reared above him, easily twice his height and more. The air\\nthundered with the drumbeat, rang with trumpet blasts.\\nThe face of the wall had been left much in the natural state of the stone, the huge blocks fitted\\ntogether so well that the joins were nearly invisible, the roughness making it seem almost a natural\\ncliff. Rand grinned. The cliffs just beyond the Sand Hills were higher, and even Perrin had climbed\\nthose. His hands sought rocky knobs, his booted feet found ridges. The drums raced him as he\\nclimbed. He refused to let them win. He would reach the top before they reached the Palace. In his\\nhaste, the stone tore his hands and scraped his knees through his breeches, but he flung his arms over\\nthe top and heaved himself up with a sense of victory.\\nHastily he twisted himself around to a seat on the flat, narrow top of the wall. The leafy\\nbranches of a towering tree stuck out over his head, but he had no thought for that. He looked across\\ntiled rooftops, but from the wall his line of sight was clear. He leaned out, just a little, and could see\\nthe Palace gate, and the Queen’s Guards drawn up there, and the expectant crowd. Expectant. Their\\nshouts drowned out by the thunder of drums and trumpets, but waiting still. He grinned. \\nI won.\\nEven as he settled in place, the first part of the procession rounded the final curve before the\\nPalace. Twenty ranks of trumpeters came first, splitting the air with peal after triumphant peal, a\\nfanfare of victory. Behind them, as many drummers thundered. Then came the banners of Caemlyn,\\nwhite lions on red, borne by mounted men, followed by the soldiers of Caemlyn, rank on rank on rank\\nof horsemen, armor gleaming, lances proudly held, crimson pennants fluttering. Treble rows of\\npikemen and archers flanked them, and came on and on after the horsemen began passing between the\\nwaiting Guards and through the Palace gates.\\nThe last of the foot soldiers rounded the curve, and behind them was a massive wagon. Sixteen\\nhorses pulled it in hitches of four. In the center of its flat bed was a large cage of iron bars, and on\\neach corner of the wagonbed sat two women, watching the cage as intently as if the procession and\\nthe crowd did not exist. Aes Sedai, he was certain. Between the wagon and the footmen, and to either\\nside, rode a dozen Warders, their cloaks swirling and tangling the eye. If the Aes Sedai ignored the\\ncrowd, the Warders scanned it as if there were no other guards but they.\\nWith all of that, it was the man in the cage who caught and held Rand’s eyes. He was not close\\nenough to see Logain’s face, as he had wanted to, but suddenly he thought he was as close as he cared\\nfor. The false Dragon was a tall man, with long, dark hair curling around his broad shoulders. He\\nheld himself upright against the sway of the wagon with one hand on the bars over his head. His\\nclothes seemed ordinary, a cloak and coat and breeches that would not have caused comment in any\\nfarming village. But the way he wore them. The way he held himself. Logain was a king in every inch\\nof him. The cage might as well not have been there. He held himself erect, head high, and looked over\\nthe crowd as if they had come to do him honor. And wherever his gaze swept, there the people fell'),\n",

When Logain’s eyes left them, they screamed with redoubled fury as if to\\nmake up for their silence, but it made no difference in the way the man stood, or in the silence that\\npassed along with him. As the wagon rolled through the Palace gates, he turned to look back at the\\nassembled masses. They howled at him, beyond words, a wave of sheer animal hate and fear, and\\nLogain threw back his head and laughed as the Palace swallowed him.\\nOther contingents followed behind the wagons, with banners representing more who had fought\\nand defeated the false Dragon. The Golden Bees of Illian, the three White Crescents of Tear, the\\nRising Sun of Cairhien, others, many others, of nations and of cities, and of great men with their own\\ntrumpets, their own drums to thunder their grandeur.

Light, he wouldn’t be in a bloody cage if he wasn’t defeated.\\nOverbalanced, he slipped and grabbed at the top of the wall, pulled himself back to a somewhat\\nsafer seat.

The cage and the Aes Sedai.\\nLogain, undefeated. No matter the cage, that had not been a defeated man. He shivered and rubbed his\\nstinging hands on his thighs.\\n“Why were the Aes Sedai watching him?” he wondered aloud.\\n“They’re keeping him from touching the True Source, silly.”\\nHe jerked to look up, toward the girl’s voice, and suddenly his precarious seat was gone.

The Aes Sedai and the\\nfalse Dragon sat watching him silently, as if neither knew the other was there. Abruptly he realized\\nthe walls of the room were becoming indistinct, fading off into gray. A sense of urgency built in him.\\nEverything was going, blurring away. When he looked back to the table, Moiraine and Logain had\\nvanished, and Ba’alzamon sat there instead. Rand’s whole body vibrated with urgency; it hummed\\ninside his head, louder and louder. The hum became the pounding of blood in his ears.\\nWith a jerk he sat up, and immediately groaned and clutched his head, swaying. His whole skull\\nhurt; his left hand found sticky dampness in his hair. He was sitting on the ground, on green grass.\\nThat troubled him, vaguely, but his head spun and everything he looked at lurched, and all he could\\nthink of was lying down until it stopped.\\nThe wall! The girl’s voice!\\nSteadying himself with one hand flat on the grass, he looked around slowly. He had to do it\\nslowly; when he tried to turn his head quickly everything started whirling again. He was in a garden,\\nor a park; a slate-paved walk meandered by through flowering bushes not six feet away, with a white\\nstone bench beside it and a leafy arbor over the bench for shade. He \\nhad\\n fallen inside the wall. \\nAnd\\nthe girl?\\nHe found the tree, close behind his back, and found her, too—climbing down out of it. She\\nreached the ground and turned to face him, and he blinked and groaned again. A deep blue velvet\\ncloak lined with pale fur rested on her shoulders, its hood hanging down behind to her waist with a\\ncluster of silver bells at the peak. They jingled when she moved. A silver filigree circlet held her\\nlong, red-gold curls, and delicate silver rings hung at her ears, while a necklace of heavy silver links\\nand dark green stones he thought were emeralds lay around her throat. Her pale blue dress was\\nsmudged with bark stains from her tree climbing, but it was still silk, and embroidered with\\npainstakingly intricate designs, the skirt slashed with inserts the color of rich cream. A wide belt of\\nwoven silver encircled her waist, and velvet slippers peeked from under the hem of her dress.\\nHe had only ever seen two women dressed in this fashion, Moiraine and the Darkfriend who had\\ntried to kill Mat and him. He could not begin to imagine who would choose to climb trees in clothes\\nlike that, but he was sure she had to be someone important. The way she was looking at him\\nredoubled the impression. She did not seem in the least troubled at having a stranger tumble into her\\ngarden. There was a self-possession about her that made him think of Nynaeve, or Moiraine.\\nHe was so enmeshed in worrying whether or not he had gotten himself into trouble, whether or\\nnot she was someone who could and would call the Queen’s Guards even on a day when they had'),\n",

She was perhaps two or three years younger than he, tall for a girl, and\\nbeautiful, her face a perfect oval framed by that mass of sunburst curls, her lips full and red, her eyes\\nbluer than he could believe. She was completely different from Egwene in height and face and body,\\nbut every bit as beautiful. He felt a twinge of guilt, but told himself that denying what his eyes saw\\nwould not bring Egwene safely to Caemlyn one whit faster.\\nA scrabbling sound came from up in the tree and bits of bark fell, followed by a boy dropping\\nlightly to the ground behind her. He was a head taller than she and a little older, but his face and hair\\nmarked him as her close kin. His coat and cloak were red and white and gold, embroidered and\\nbrocaded, and for a male even more ornate than hers. That increased Rand’s anxiety. Only on a\\nfeastday would any ordinary man dress in anything like that, and never with that much grandeur. This\\nwas no public park. Perhaps the Guards were too busy to bother with trespassers.\\nThe boy studied Rand over the girl’s shoulder, fingering the dagger at his waist. It seemed more\\na nervous habit than any thought that he might use it. Not completely, though. The boy had the same\\nself-possession as the girl, and they both looked at him as if he were a puzzle to be solved. He had the\\nodd feeling that the girl, at least, was cata loguing everything about him from the condition of his\\nboots to the state of his cloak.\\n“We will never hear the end of this, Elayne, if mother finds out,” the boy said suddenly. “She\\ntold us to stay in our rooms, but you just had to get a look at Logain, didn’t you? Now look what it has\\ngot us.”\\n“Be quiet, Gawyn.” She was clearly the younger of the two, but she spoke as though she took it\\nfor granted that he would obey. The boy’s face struggled as if he had more to say, but to Rand’s\\nsurprise he held his peace. “Are you all right?” she said suddenly.\\nIt took Rand a minute to realize she was speaking to him. When he did, he tried to struggle to his\\nfeet. “I’m fine. I just—” He tottered, and his legs gave way. He sat back down hard. His head swam.\\n“I’ll just climb back over the wall,” he muttered. He attempted to stand again, but she put a hand on\\nhis shoulder, pressing him down. He was so dizzy the slight pressure was enough to hold him in\\nplace.\\n“You \\nare\\n hurt.” Gracefully she knelt beside him. Her fingers gently parted the blood-matted hair\\non the left side of his head. “You must have struck a branch coming down. You will be lucky if you\\ndidn’t break anything more than your scalp. I don’t think I ever saw anyone as skillful at climbing as\\nyou, but you don’t do so well falling.”\\n“You’ll get blood on your hands,” he said, drawing back.\\nFirmly she pulled his head back to where she could get at it. “Hold still.” She did not speak\\nsharply, but again there was that note in her voice as if she expected to be obeyed. “It does not look\\ntoo\\n bad, thank the Light.” From pockets on the inside of her cloak she began taking out an array of tiny\\nvials and twisted packets of paper, finishing with a handful of wadded bandage.\\nHe stared at the collection in amazement. It was the sort of thing he would have expected a\\nWisdom to carry, not someone dressed as she was. She had gotten blood on her fingers, he saw, but it\\ndid not seem to bother her.\\n“Give me your water flask, Gawyn,” she said. “I need to wash this.”\\nThe boy she called Gawyn unfastened a leather bottle from his belt and handed it to her, then\\nsquatted easily at Rand’s feet with his arms folded on his knees. Elayne went about what she was\\ndoing in a very workmanlike manner. He did not flinch at the sting of cold water when she washed the\\ncut in his scalp, but she held the top of his head with one hand as if she expected him to try to pull'),\n",

The ointment she smoothed on after, from one of her small\\nvials, soothed almost as much as one of Nynaeve’s preparations would have.\\nGawyn smiled at him as she worked, a calming smile, as if he, too, expected Rand to jerk away\\nand maybe even run. “She’s always finding stray cats and birds with broken wings. You are the first\\nhuman being she has had to work on.” He hesitated, then added, “Do not be offended. I am not calling\\nyou a stray.” It was not an apology, just a statement of fact.\\n“No offense taken,” Rand said stiffly. But the pair were acting as if he were a skittish horse.\\n“She does know what she is doing,” Gawyn said. “She has had the best teachers. So do not fear,\\nyou are in good hands.”\\nElayne pressed some of the bandaging against his temple and pulled a silk scarf from her belt,\\nblue and cream and gold. For any girl in Emond’s Field it would have been a treasured feastday\\ncloth. Elayne deftly began winding it around his head to hold the wad of bandage in place.\\n“You can’t use that,” he protested.\\nShe went on winding. “I told you to hold still,” she said calmly.\\nRand looked at Gawyn. “Does she always expect everybody to do what she tells them?”\\nA flash of surprise crossed the young man’s face, and his mouth tightened with amusement.\\n“Most of the time she does. And most of the time they do.”\\n“Hold this,” Elayne said. “Put your hand there while I tie—” She exclaimed at the sight of his\\nhands. “You did not do that falling. Climbing where you should not have been climbing is more like\\nit.” Quickly finishing her knot, she turned his hands palms upward in front of him, muttering to herself\\nabout how little water was left. The washing made the lacerations burn, but her touch was\\nsurprisingly delicate. “Hold still, this time.”\\nThe vial of ointment was produced again. She spread it thinly along the scrapes, all of her\\nattention apparently on rubbing it in without hurting him. A coolness spread through his hands, as if\\nshe were rubbing the torn places away.\\n“Most of the time they do exactly what she says,” Gawyn went on with an affectionate grin at the\\ntop of her head. “Most people. Not Mother, of course. Or Elaida. And not Lini. Lini was her nurse.\\nYou can’t give orders to someone who switched you for stealing figs when you were little. And even\\nnot so little.” Elayne raised her head long enough to give him a dangerous look. He cleared his throat\\nand carefully blanked his expression before hurrying on. “And Gareth, of course. No one gives orders\\nto Gareth.”\\n“Not even Mother,” Elayne said, bending her head back over Rand’s hands. “She makes\\nsuggestions, and he always does what she suggests, but I’ve never heard her give him a command.”\\nShe shook her head.\\n“I don’t know why that always surprises you,” Gawyn answered her. “Even you don’t try telling\\nGareth what to do. He’s served three Queens and been Captain-General, and First Prince Regent, for\\ntwo. I daresay there are some think he’s more a symbol of the Throne of Andor than the Queen is.”\\n“Mother should go ahead and marry him,” she said absently. Her attention was on Rand’s hands.\\n“She wants to; she can’t hide it from me. And it would solve so many problems.”\\nGawyn shook his head. “One of them must bend first. Mother cannot, and Gareth will not.”\\n“If she commanded him. . . .”\\n“He would obey. I think. But she won’t. You know she won’t.”\\nAbruptly they turned to stare at Rand.

He held himself tightly in rein against\\nthe urge to run, but the need to get away filled him, to get away before anyone else discovered him\\nthere.\\nElayne and Gawyn watched him calmly, and when he leaped up they rose gracefully, not hurried\\nin the least. He put up a hand to pull the scarf from his head, and Elayne seized his elbow. “Stop that.\\nYou will start the bleeding again.” Her voice was still calm, still sure that he would do as he was\\ntold.\\n“I have to go,” Rand said. “I’ll just climb back over the wall and—”\\n“You really didn’t know.” For the first time she seemed as startled as he was. “Do you mean you\\nclimbed up on that wall to see Logain without even knowing where you were?

He sketched a bow to each of them. “If you’ll pardon\\nme, ah . . . my Lady.” In the stories, royal courts were full of people all calling one another Lord and\\nLady and Royal Highness and Majesty, but if he had ever heard the correct form of address for the\\nDaughter-Heir, he could not think clearly enough to remember. He could not think clearly about\\nanything beyond the need to be far away. “If you will pardon me, I’ll just leave now. Ah . . . thank you\\nfor the. . . .” He touched the scarf around his head. “Thank you.”\\n“Without even telling us your name?” Gawyn said. “A poor payment for Elayne’s care.

There had been a note of surprise in the young man’s voice,\\nand Rand caught some of it still on his face when he turned. Gawyn replaced it with a pleasant smile\\nso quickly, though, that he almost doubted what he had seen.\\n“Tabac and wool,” Gawyn said. “I have to know the principal products of every part of the\\nRealm.

And he is under my protection,\\nGalad.”\\nRand tried to remember what he had heard from Master Kinch, and since from Master Gill.\\nGaladedrid Damodred was Elayne’s half-brother, Elayne’s and Gawyn’s, if he remembered\\ncorrectly; the three shared the same father. Master Kinch might not have liked Taringail Damodred\\ntoo well—neither did anyone else that he had heard—but the son was well thought of by wearers of\\nthe red and the white alike, if talk in the city was any guide.\\n“I am aware of your fondness for strays, Elayne,” the slender man said reasonably, “but the\\nfellow is armed, and he hardly looks reputable. In these days, we cannot be too careful. If he’s a loyal\\nQueen’s man, what is he doing here where he does not belong?

Twice\\nhe has saved my life, with none to know if he held his hand. If he had not, he would be your First\\nPrince of the Sword in my place.”\\n“Never, Gawyn. I would choose anyone before Galad. Anyone. The lowest stableboy.”\\nSuddenly she smiled and gave her brother a mock-stern look. “You say I am fond of giving orders.\\nWell, I command you to let nothing happen to you. I command you to be my First Prince of the Sword\\nwhen I take the throne—the light send that day is far off!—and to lead the armies of Andor with the\\nsort of honor Galad cannot dream of.”\\n“As you command, my Lady.” Gawyn laughed, his bow a parody of Galad’s.\\nElayne gave Rand a thoughtful frown. “Now we must get you out of here quickly.”\\n“Galad always does the right thing,” Gawyn explained, “even when he should not. In this case,\\nfinding a stranger in the gardens, the right thing is to notify the Palace guards. Which I suspect he is on\\nhis way to do right this minute.”\\n“Then it’s time I was back over the wall,” Rand said. \\nA fine day for going unnoticed! I might\\nas well carry a sign!\\n He turned to the wall, but Elayne caught his arm.\\n“Not after the trouble I went to with your hands. You’ll only make fresh scrapes and then let\\nsome back-alley crone put the Light knows what on them. There is a small gate on the other side of the\\ngarden. It’s overgrown, and no one but me even remembers it’s there.”'),\n",

He started once more for the wall, knowing he\\nwould be no more than halfway up before the guards arrived, but unable to stand still.\\nBefore he had taken three steps red-uniformed men burst into sight, breastplates catching the sun\\nas they dashed up the path. Others came like breaking waves of scarlet and polished steel, seemingly\\nfrom every direction. Some held drawn swords; others only waited to set their boots before raising\\nbows and nocking feathered shafts. Behind the barred faceguards every eye was grim, and every\\nbroadhead arrow was pointed unwaveringly at him.\\nElayne and Gawyn leaped as one, putting themselves between him and the arrows, their arms\\nspread to cover him. He stood very still and kept his hands in plain sight, away from his sword.\\nWhile the thud of boots and the creak of bowstrings still hung in the air, one of the soldiers, with\\nthe golden knot of an officer on his shoulder, shouted, “My Lady, my Lord, down, quickly!”\\nDespite her outstretched arms Elayne drew herself up regally. “You dare to bring bare steel into\\nmy presence, Tallanvor? Gareth Bryne will have you mucking stables with the meanest trooper for\\nthis, if you are lucky!”\\nThe soldiers exchanged puzzled glances, and some of the bowmen uneasily half lowered their\\nbows. Only then did Elayne let her arms down, as if she had only held them up because she wished to.\\nGawyn hesitated, then followed her example. Rand could count the bows that had not been lowered.\\nThe muscles of his stomach tensed as though they could stop a broadhead shaft at twenty paces.\\nThe man with the officer’s knot seemed the most perplexed of all. “My Lady, forgive me, but\\nLord Galadedrid reported a dirty peasant skulking in the gardens, armed and endangering my Lady\\nElayne and my Lord Gawyn.” His eyes went to Rand, and his voice finned. “If my Lady and my Lord\\nwill please to step aside, I will take the villain into custody. There is too much riff-raff in the city\\nthese days.”\\n“I doubt very much if Galad reported anything of the kind,” Elayne said. “Galad does not lie.”\\n“Sometimes I wish he would,” Gawyn said softly, for Rand’s ear. “Just once. It might make\\nliving with him easier.”\\n“This man is my guest,” Elayne continued, “and here under my protection. You may withdraw,\\nTallanvor.”\\n“I regret that will not be possible, my Lady. As my Lady knows, the Queen, your lady mother,\\nhas given orders regarding anyone on Palace grounds without Her Majesty’s permission, and word\\nhas been sent to Her Majesty of this intruder.” There was more than a hint of satisfaction in\\nTallanvor’s voice. Rand suspected the officer had had to accept other commands from Elayne that he\\ndid not think proper; this time the man was not about to, not when he had a perfect excuse.\\nElayne stared back at Tallanvor; for once she seemed at a loss.\\nRand looked a question at Gawyn, and Gawyn understood. “Prison,” he murmured.

As Tallanvor led them into the Palace, he looked back at the garden, at all the green\\nstreaked with blossoms, colors wrought for a Queen by an Aes Sedai’s hand. He was in deep water,\\nand there was no bank in sight.\\nPalace servants filled the halls, in red liveries with collars and cuffs of white, the White Lion on\\nthe left breast of their tunics, scurrying about intent on tasks that were not readily apparent. When the\\nsoldiers trooped by with Elayne and Gawyn, and Rand, in their midst, they stopped dead in their\\ntracks to stare openmouthed.\\nThrough the middle of all the consternation a gray-striped tomcat wandered unconcernedly down\\nthe hall, weaving between the goggling servants. Suddenly the cat struck Rand as odd. He had been in\\nBaerlon long enough to know that even the meanest shop had cats lurking in every corner. Since\\nentering the Palace, the tom was the only cat he had seen.\\n“You don’t have rats?” he said in disbelief. \\nEvery\\n place had rats.\\n“Elaida doesn’t like rats,” Gawyn muttered vaguely. He was frowning worriedly down the hall,\\napparently already seeing the coming meeting with the Queen. “We never have rats.”\\n“Both of you be quiet.” Elayne’s voice was sharp, but as absent as her brother’s. “I am trying to\\nthink.”\\nRand watched the cat over his shoulder until the guards took him round a corner, hiding the tom\\nfrom sight. A lot of cats would have made him feel better; it would have been nice if there was one\\nthing normal about the Palace, even if it was rats.\\nThe path Tallanvor took turned so many times that Rand lost his sense of direction. Finally the\\nyoung officer stopped before tall double doors of dark wood with a rich glow, not so grand as some\\nthey had passed, but still carved all over with rows of lions, finely wrought in detail. A liveried\\nservant stood to either side.\\n“At least it isn’t the Grand Hall.” Gawyn laughed unsteadily. “I never heard that Mother\\ncommanded anyone’s head cut off from here.” He sounded as if he thought she might set a precedent.\\nTallanvor reached for Rand’s sword, but Elayne moved to cut him off. “He is my guest, and by\\ncustom and law, guests of the royal family may go armed even in Mother’s presence. Or will you\\ndeny my word that he is my guest?”\\nTallanvor hesitated, locking eyes with her, then nodded. “Very well, my Lady.” She smiled at\\nRand as Tallanvor stepped back, but it lasted only a moment. “First rank to accompany me,”\\nTallanvor commanded. “Announce the Lady Elayne and the Lord Gawyn to Her Majesty,” he told the\\ndoorkeepers. “Also Guardsman-Lieutenant Tallanvor, at Her Majesty’s command, with the intruder\\nunder guard.”\\nElayne scowled at Tallanvor, but the doors were already swinging open. A sonorous voice\\nsounded, announcing those who came.\\nGrandly Elayne swept through the doors, spoiling her regal entrance only a little by motioning\\nfor Rand to keep close behind her. Gawyn squared his shoulders and strode in flanking her, one\\nmeasured pace to her rear. Rand followed, uncertainly keeping level with Gawyn on her other side.\\nTallanvor stayed close to Rand, and ten soldiers came with him. The doors closed silently behind\\nthem.\\nSuddenly Elayne dropped into a deep curtsy, simultaneously bowing from the waist, and stayed\\nthere, holding her skirt wide. Rand gave a start, then hastily emulated Gawyn and the other men,\\nshifting awkwardly until he had it right. Down on his right knee, head bowed, bending forward to\\npress the knuckles of his right hand against the marble tiles, his left hand resting on the end of his\\nsword hilt. Gawyn, without a sword, put his hand on his dagger the same way.'),\n",

And\\nangry over being afraid of the guards. He had done nothing to be fearful for. He knew his fear was not\\nTallanvor’s fault, but he was angry at him anyway.\\nEveryone held their positions, frozen as if waiting for the spring thaw. He did not know what\\nthey were waiting for, but he took the opportunity to study the place to which he had been brought. He\\nkept his head down, just turning it enough to see. Tallanvor’s scowl deepened, but he ignored it.\\nThe square chamber was about the size of the common room at The Queen’s Blessing, its walls\\npresenting hunting scenes carved in relief in stone of the purest white. The tapestries between the\\ncarvings were gentle images of bright flowers and brilliantly plumaged hummingbirds, except for the\\ntwo at the far end of the room, where the White Lion of Andor stood taller than a man on scarlet\\nfields. Those two hangings flanked a dais, and on the dais a carved and gilded throne where sat the\\nQueen.\\nA bluff, blocky man stood bareheaded by the Queen’s right hand in the red of the Queen’s\\nGuards, with four golden knots on the shoulder of his cloak and wide golden bands breaking the white\\nof his cuffs. His temples were heavy with gray, but he looked as strong and immovable as a rock.\\nThat had to be the Captain-General, Gareth Bryne. Behind the throne and to the other side a woman in\\ndeep green silk sat on a low stool, knitting something out of dark, almost black, wool. At first the\\nknitting made Rand think she was old, but at second glance he could not put an age to her at all.\\nYoung, old, he did not know. Her attention seemed to be entirely on her needles and yarn, just as if\\nthere were not a Queen within arm’s reach of her. She was a handsome woman, outwardly placid, yet\\nthere was something terrible in her concentration. There was no sound in the room except for the click\\nof her needles.\\nHe tried to look at everything, yet his eyes kept going back to the woman with the gleaming\\nwreath of finely wrought roses on her brow, the Rose Crown of Andor. A long red stole, the Lion of\\nAndor marching along its length, hung over her silken dress of red and white pleats, and when she\\ntouched the Captain-General’s arm with her left hand, a ring in the shape of the Great Serpent, eating\\nits own tail, glittered. Yet it was not the grandeur of clothes or jewelry or even crown that drew\\nRand’s eyes again and again: it was the woman who wore them.\\nMorgase had her daughter’s beauty, matured and ripened. Her face and figure, her presence,\\nfilled the room like a light that dimmed the other two with her. If she had been a widow in Emond’s\\nField, she would have had a line of suitors outside her door even if she was the worst cook and most\\nslovenly house keeper in the Two Rivers. He saw her studying him and ducked his head, afraid she\\nmight be able to tell his thoughts from his face. \\nLight, thinking about the Queen like she was a\\nvillage woman! You fool!\\n“You may rise,” Morgase said in a rich, warm voice that held Elayne’s assurance of obedience a\\nhundred times over.\\nRand stood with the rest.\\n“Mother—” Elayne began, but Morgase cut her off.\\n“You have been climbing trees, it seems, daughter.” Elayne plucked a stray fragment of bark\\nfrom her dress and, finding there was no place to put it, held it clenched in her hand. “In fact,”\\nMorgase went on calmly, “it would seem that despite my orders to the contrary you have contrived to\\ntake your look at this Logain.

Bryne remained impassive, as if he had\\nnot noticed, but Rand thought those eyes noticed everything. “That, Gawyn, is as much the duty of the\\nFirst Prince as is leading the armies of Andor. Perhaps if your training is intensified, you will find\\nless time for letting your sister lead you into trouble. I will ask the Captain-General to see that you do\\nnot lack for things to do on the journey north.”\\nGawyn shifted his feet as if about to protest, then bowed his head instead. “As you command,\\nmother.”\\nElayne grimaced. “Mother, Gawyn cannot keep me out of trouble if he is not with me. It was for\\nthat reason alone he left his rooms. Mother, surely there could be no harm in just looking at Logain.\\nAlmost everyone in the city was closer to him than we.”\\n“Everyone in the city is not the Daughter-Heir.” Sharpness underlay the Queen’s voice. “I have\\nseen this fellow Logain from close, and he is dangerous, child. Caged, with Aes Sedai to guard him\\nevery minute, he is still as dangerous as a wolf. I wish he had never been brought near Caemlyn.”\\n“He will be dealt with in Tar Valon.” The woman on the stool did not take her eyes from her\\nknitting as she spoke. “What is important is that the people see that the Light has once again\\nvanquished the Dark. And that they see you are part of that victory, Morgase.”\\nMorgase waved a dismissive hand. “I would still rather he had never come near Caemlyn.\\nElayne, I know your mind.”\\n“Mother,” Elayne protested, “I do mean to obey you. Truly I do.”\\n“You do?” Morgase asked in mock surprise, then chuckled. “Yes, you do try to be a dutiful\\ndaughter. But you constantly test how far you may go. Well, I did the same with my mother. That spirit\\nwill stand you in good stead when you ascend to the throne, but you are not Queen yet, child. You\\nhave disobeyed me and had your look at Logain. Be satisfied with that. On the journey north you will\\nnot be allowed within one hundred paces of him, neither you nor Gawyn. If I did not know just how\\nhard your lessons will be in Tar Valon, I would send Lini along to see that you obey. She, at least,\\nseems able to make you do as you must.”\\nElayne bowed her head sullenly.\\nThe woman behind the throne seemed occupied with counting her stitches. “In one week,” she\\nsaid suddenly, “you will be wanting to come home to your mother. In a month you will be wanting to\\nrun away with the Traveling People. But my sisters will keep you away from the unbeliever. That sort\\nof thing is not for you, not yet.” Abruptly she turned on the stool to look intently at Elayne, all her\\nplacidity gone as if it had never been. “You have it in you to be the greatest Queen that Andor has\\never seen, that any land has seen in more than a thousand years. It is for that we will shape you, if you\\nhave the strength for it.”\\nRand stared at her. She had to be Elaida, the Aes Sedai. Suddenly he was glad he had not come\\nto her for help, no matter what her Ajah. A sternness far beyond Moiraine’s radiated from her. He had\\nsometimes thought of Moiraine as steel covered with velvet; with Elaida the velvet was only an\\nillusion.\\n“Enough, Elaida,” Morgase said, frowning uneasily. “She has heard that more than enough. The\\nWheel weaves as the Wheel wills.” For a moment she was silent, looking at her daughter. “Now there\\nis the problem of this young man”—she gestured to Rand without taking her eyes off Elayne’s face\\n—“and how and why he came here, and why you claimed guest-right for him to your brother.”\\n“May I speak, mother?” When Morgase nodded her assent, Elayne told of events simply, from\\nthe time she first saw Rand climbing up the slope to the wall.

I daresay they seldom even think to remember they are part of the Realm.” Rand\\nshrugged uncomfortably, recalling his surprise when he was told the Two Rivers was part of the\\nRealm of Andor. The Queen saw him, and smiled ruefully at her daughter. “You see, child?”\\nElaida had put down her knitting, Rand realized, and was studying him. She rose from her stool\\nand slowly came down from the dais to stand before him. “From the Two Rivers?” she said. She\\nreached a hand toward his head; he pulled away from her touch, and she let her hand drop. “With that\\nred in his hair, and gray eyes? Two Rivers people are dark of hair and eye, and they seldom have\\nsuch height.” Her hand darted out to push back his coat sleeve, exposing lighter skin the sun had not\\nreached so often. “Or such skin.”\\nIt was an effort not to clench his fists. “I was born in Emond’s Field,” he said stiffly. “My\\nmother was an outlander; that’s where my eyes come from. My father is Tam al’Thor, a shepherd and\\nfarmer, as I am.”\\nElaida nodded slowly, never taking her eyes from his face. He met her gaze with a levelness that\\nbelied the sour feeling in his stomach. He saw her note the steadiness of his look. Still meeting him\\neye to eye, she moved her hand slowly toward him again. He resolved not to flinch this time.\\nIt was his sword she touched, not him, her hand closing around the hilt at the very top. Her\\nfingers tightened and her eyes opened wide with surprise. “A shepherd from the Two Rivers,” she\\nsaid softly, a whisper meant to be heard by all, “with a heron-mark sword.”\\nThose last few words acted on the chamber as if she had announced the Dark One. Leather and\\nmetal creaked behind Rand, boots scuffling on the marble tiles. From the corner of his eye he could\\nsee Tallanvor and another of the guardsmen backing away from him to gain room, hands on their\\nswords, prepared to draw and, from their faces, prepared to die. In two quick strides Gareth Bryne\\nwas at the front of the dais, between Rand and the Queen. Even Gawyn put himself in front of Elayne,\\na worried look on his face and a hand on his dagger. Elayne herself looked at him as if she were\\nseeing him for the first time. Morgase did not change expression, but her hands tightened on the gilded\\narms of her throne.\\nOnly Elaida showed less reaction than the Queen. The Aes Sedai gave no sign that she had said\\nanything out of the ordinary. She took her hand from the sword, causing the soldiers to tense even\\nmore. Her eyes stayed on his, unruffled and calculating.\\n“Surely,” Morgase said, her voice level, “he is too young to have earned a heron-mark blade. He\\ncannot be any older than Gawyn.”\\n“It belongs with him,” Gareth Bryne said.\\nThe Queen looked at him in surprise. “How can that be?”\\n“I do not know, Morgase,” Bryne said slowly. “He \\nis\\n too young, yet still it belongs with him,\\nand he with it. Look at his eyes. Look how he stands, how the sword fits him, and he it.

Don’t say you have not found a room\\nsomewhere. You look a little tattered, but you have had a chance to freshen.

It was to Elaida that she spoke, though. “What are you naming him? Darkfriend? One\\nof Logain’s followers?”\\n“The Dark One stirs in Shayol Ghul,” the Aes Sedai replied. “The Shadow lies across the\\nPattern, and the future is balanced on the point of a pin. This one is dangerous.”\\nSuddenly Elayne moved, throwing herself onto her knees before the throne. “Mother, I beg you\\nnot to harm him. He would have left immediately had I not stopped him. He wanted to go. It was I\\nwho made him stay. I cannot believe he is a Darkfriend.”\\nMorgase made a soothing gesture toward her daughter, but her eyes remained on Rand. “Is this a\\nForetelling, Elaida? Are you reading the Pattern?

Unless, Aes Sedai, you have more to Foretell concerning him?”\\n“I have said all that I have read in the Pattern, Captain-General,” Elaida said. She flashed a hard\\nsmile at Rand, a smile that barely bent her lips, mocking his inability to say that she was not telling\\nthe truth. “A few weeks imprisoned will not harm him, and it may give me a chance to learn more.”\\nHunger filled her eyes, deepening his chill. “Perhaps another Foretelling will come.”\\nFor a time Morgase considered, chin on her fist and elbow on the arm of her throne. Rand would\\nhave shifted under her frowning gaze if he could have moved at all, but Elaida’s eyes froze him solid.\\nFinally the Queen spoke.\\n“Suspicion is smothering Caemlyn, perhaps all of Andor. Fear and black suspicion. Women\\ndenounce their neighbors for Darkfriends. Men scrawl the Dragon’s Fang on the doors of people they\\nhave known for years. I will not become part of it.”\\n“Morgase—” Elaida began, but the Queen cut her off.\\n“I will not become part of it. When I took the throne I swore to uphold justice for the high and\\nthe low, and I will uphold it even if I am the last in Andor to remember justice. Rand al’Thor, do you\\nswear under the Light that your father, a shepherd in the Two Rivers, gave you this heronmark\\nblade?”\\nRand worked his mouth to get enough moisture to speak. “I do.” Abruptly remembering to whom\\nhe was speaking he hastily added, “My Queen.” Lord Gareth raised a heavy eyebrow, but Morgase\\ndid not seem to mind.\\n“And you climbed the garden wall simply to gain a look at the false Dragon?”\\n“Yes, my Queen.”\\n“Do you mean harm to the throne of Andor, or to my daughter, or my son?” Her tone said the last\\ntwo would gain him even shorter shrift than the first.\\n“I mean no harm to anyone, my Queen. To you and yours least of all.”\\n“I will give you justice then, Rand al’Thor,” she said. “First, because I have the advantage of\\nElaida and Gareth in having heard Two Rivers speech when I was young. You have not the look, but\\nif a dim memory can serve me you have the Two Rivers on your tongue. Second, no one with your\\nhair and eyes would claim that he is a Two Rivers shepherd unless it was true. And that your father\\ngave you a heron-mark blade is too preposterous to be a lie. And third, the voice that whispers to me\\nthat the best lie is often one too ridiculous to be taken for a lie . . . that voice is not proof. I will\\nuphold the laws I have made. I give you your freedom, Rand al’Thor, but I suggest you take a care\\nwhere you trespass in the future. If you are found on the Palace grounds again, it will not go so easily\\nwith you.”'),\n",

He blinked, startled to find himself in the great court at the front of the\\nPalace, standing at the tall, gilded gates, gleaming in the sun. Those gates would not be opened for a\\nsingle man, certainly not for a trespasser, even if the Daughter-Heir did claim guest-right for him.\\nWordlessly Tallanvor unbarred a sally-port, a small door set within one gate.\\n“It is the custom,” Elayne said, “to escort guests as far as the gates, but not to watch them go. It is\\nthe pleasure of a guest’s company that should be remembered, not the sadness of parting.”\\n“Thank you, my Lady,” Rand said. He touched the scarf bandaging his head. “For everything.\\nCustom in the Two Rivers is for a guest to bring a small gift. I’m afraid I have nothing. Although,” he\\nadded dryly, “apparently I did teach you something of the Two Rivers folk.”\\n“If I had told Mother I think you are handsome, she certainly would have had you locked in a\\ncell.” Elayne favored him with a dazzling smile. “Fare you well, Rand al’Thor.”\\nGaping, he watched her go, a younger version of Morgase’s beauty and majesty.\\n“Do not try to bandy words with her.” Gawyn laughed. “She will win every time.”\\nRand nodded absently. \\nHandsome? Light, the Daughter-Heir to the throne of Andor!\\n He gave\\nhimself a shake to clear his head.\\nGawyn seemed to be waiting for something.

Seeing nothing, he sat back down again, careful not to disturb the animal. “Fools tried to steal\\nsome of the cats a while back,” he said. He examined his knuckles before going back to his\\nscratching. “Good money in cats these days.”\\nThe two men showing the white were still across the way, Rand saw, one with a black eye and a\\nswollen jaw. That one wore a sour scowl and rubbed his sword hilt with a sullen eagerness as he\\nwatched the inn.\\n“Where’s Master Gill?” Rand asked.\\n“Library,” Lamgwin replied. The cat began purring, and he grinned. “Nothing bothers a cat for\\nlong, not even somebody trying to stick him in a sack.”\\nRand hurried inside, through the common room, now with its usual complement of men wearing\\nthe red and talking over their ale. About the false Dragon, and whether the Whitecloaks would make\\ntrouble when he was taken north. No one cared what happened to Logain, but they all knew the\\nDaughter-Heir and Lord Gawyn would be traveling in the party, and no man there would countenance\\nany risk to them.\\nHe found Master Gill in the library, playing stones with Loial. A plump tabby sat on the table,\\nfeet tucked under her, watching their hands move over the cross-hatched board.\\nThe Ogier placed another stone with a touch oddly delicate for his thick fingers. Shaking his\\nhead, Master Gill took the excuse of Rand’s appearance to turn from the table. Loial almost always\\nwon at stones. “I was beginning to worry where you were, lad. Thought you might have had trouble\\nwith some of those white-flashing traitors, or run into that beggar or something.”\\nFor a minute Rand stood there with his mouth open. He had forgotten all about that bundle-of-\\nrags of a man. “I saw him,” he said finally, “but that’s nothing. I saw the Queen, too, and Elaida;\\nthat’s where the trouble is.”\\nMaster Gill snorted a laugh. “The Queen, eh? You don’t say.

Two days at the most. Can you get Mat on his feet in that time, or should I\\nsend for Mother Grubb?”\\nRand gave him a perplexed look. “Two days?”\\n“Elaida is Queen Morgase’s advisor, right next to Captain-General Gareth Bryne himself.\\nMaybe ahead of him. If she sets the Queen’s Guards looking for you—Lord Gareth won’t stop her\\nunless she interferes with their other duties—well, the Guards can search every inn in Caemlyn in\\ntwo days. And that’s saying some ill chance doesn’t bring them here the first day, or the first hour.\\nMaybe there’s a little time if they start over at the Crown and Lion, but none for dawdling.”\\nRand nodded slowly. “If I can’t get Mat out of that bed, you send for Mother Grubb. I have a\\nlittle money left. Maybe enough.”\\n“I’ll take care of Mother Grubb,” the innkeeper said gruffly. “And I suppose I can lend you a\\ncouple of horses.

A good friend.”\\nMaster Gill seemed embarrassed. He shrugged his shoulders and cleared his throat and looked\\ndown. That brought his eyes to the stones board, and he jerked them away again. Loial was definitely\\nwinning. “Aye, well, Thom’s always been a good friend to me. If he’s willing to go out of his way for\\nyou, I can do a little bit, too.”\\n“I would like to go with you when you leave, Rand,” Loial said suddenly.\\n“I thought that was settled, Loial.” He hesitated—Master Gill still did not know the whole of the\\ndanger—then added, “You know what waits for Mat and me, what’s chasing us.”\\n“Darkfriends,” the Ogier replied in a placid rumble, “and Aes Sedai, and the Light knows what\\nelse.

There’s Whitecloaks in\\nthe common room.”\\nMaster Gill leaped up with an oath, sending the cat jumping from the table to stalk out of the\\nroom, tail stiff and offended. “I’ll come. Run tell them I’m coming, then stay out of their way. You\\nhear me, girl?

It is your turn.”\\nMaster Gill grimaced. “If it isn’t one thing, it’s another,” he muttered as he hurried from the\\nroom.\\nRand followed him, but slowly. He had no more desire than Loial to become involved with the\\nChildren. \\nThis man stands at the heart of it.\\n He stopped at the door to the common room, where he\\ncould see what went on, but far enough back that he hoped he would not be noticed.\\nDead silence filled the room. Five Whitecloaks stood in the middle of the floor, studiously being\\nignored by the folk at the tables. One of them had the silver lightning-flash of an under-officer beneath\\nthe sunburst on his cloak. Lamgwin was lounging against the wall by the front door, intently cleaning\\nhis fingernails with a splinter. Four more of the guards Master Gill had hired were spaced across the\\nwall from him, all industriously paying no attention at all to the Whitecloaks. If the Children of the\\nLight noticed anything, they gave no sign. Only the under-officer showed any emotion at all,\\nimpatiently tapping his steel-backed gauntlets against his palm as he waited for the innkeeper.\\nMaster Gill crossed the room to him quickly, a cautiously neutral look on his face. “The Light\\nillumine you,” he said with a careful bow, not too deep, but not slight enough to actually be insulting,\\neither, “and our good Queen Morgase. How may I help—”\\n“I’ve no time for your drivel, innkeeper,” the under-officer snapped. “I’ve been to twenty inns\\nalready today, each a worse pigsty than the last, and I’ll see twenty more before the sun sets.

Suddenly every man in the room was on his feet. They stood\\nstill as statues, but every one staring grimly at the Whitecloaks. The under-officer did not appear to\\nnotice, but the four behind him looked around uneasily.\\n“It will go easier with you, innkeeper,” the under-officer said, “if you cooperate. The temper of\\nthe times goes hard with those who shelter Darkfriends. I wouldn’t think an inn with the Dragon’s\\nFang on its door would get much custom. Might have trouble with fire, with that on your door.”\\n“You get out of here now,” Master Gill said quietly, “or I’ll send for the Queen’s Guards to cart\\nwhat’s left of you to the middens.”\\nLamgwin’s sword rasped out of its sheath, and the coarse scrape of steel on leather was\\nrepeated throughout the room as swords and daggers filled hands. Serving maids scurried for the\\ndoors.\\nThe under-officer looked around in scornful disbelief. “The Dragon’s Fang—”\\n“Won’t help you five,” Master Gill finished for him. He held up a clenched fist and raised his\\nforefinger. “One.”\\n“You must be mad, innkeeper, threatening the Children of the Light.”\\n“Whitecloaks hold no writ in Caemlyn. Two.”\\n“Can you really believe this will end here?”\\n“Three.”\\n“We’ll be back,” the under-officer snapped, and then he was hastily turning his men around,\\ntrying to pretend he was leaving in good order and in his own time. He was hampered in this by the\\neagerness his men showed for the door, not running, but not making secret that they wanted to be\\noutside.\\nLamgwin stood across the door with his sword, only giving way in response to Master Gill’s\\nfrantic waves. When the Whitecloaks were gone, the innkeeper dropped heavily onto a chair. He\\nrubbed a hand across his forehead, then stared at it as if surprised that it was not covered with sweat.\\nAll over the room men seated themselves again, laughing over what they had done. Some went over to\\nclap Master Gill on the shoulder.\\nWhen he saw Rand, the innkeeper tottered off the chair and over to him. “Who would have\\nthought I had it in me to be a hero?” he said wonderingly. “The Light illumine me.” Abruptly he gave\\nhimself a shake, and his voice regained almost its normal tone. “You’ll have to stay out of sight until I\\ncan get you out of the city.” With a careful look back into the common room, he pushed Rand deeper\\ninto the hall. “That lot will be back, or else a few spies wearing red for the day. After that little show\\nI put on, I doubt they’ll care whether you’re here or not, but they’ll act as though you are.”\\n“That’s crazy,” Rand protested. At the innkeeper’s gesture he lowered his voice. “The\\nWhitecloaks don’t have any reason to be after me.”\\n“I don’t know about reasons, lad, but they’re after you and Mat for certain sure. What \\nhave\\n you\\nbeen up to? Elaida \\nand\\n the Whitecloaks.”\\nRand raised his hands in protest, then let them fall. It made no sense, but he had heard the\\nWhitecloak. “What about you? The Whitecloaks will make trouble for you even when they don’t find\\nus.”\\n“No worries about that, lad. The Queen’s Guards still uphold the law, even if they do let traitors\\nstrut around showing white. As for the night . . . well, Lamgwin and his friends might not get much\\nsleep, but I could almost pity anybody who tries to put a mark on my door.”\\nGilda appeared beside them, dropping a curtsy to Master Gill. “Sir, there’s . . . there’s a lady.

It’s nobody’s business.” Gilda bobbed again and darted\\ndown the hallway, flashing glances over her shoulder at Rand as she went. “In five minutes”—Master\\nGill sighed—“she will be telling the other women you’re a prince in disguise. By nightfall it will be\\nall over the New City.”\\n“Master Gill,” Rand said, “I never mentioned Mat to Elayne. It can’t be—” Suddenly a huge\\nsmile lit up his face, and he ran for the kitchens.\\n“Wait!” the innkeeper called behind him. “Wait until you know. Wait, you fool!”\\nRand threw open the door to the kitchens, and there they were. Moiraine rested her serene eyes\\non him, unsurprised. Nynaeve and Egwene ran laughing to throw their arms around him, with Perrin\\ncrowding in behind them, all three patting his shoulders as if they had to be convinced that he was\\nreally there. In the doorway leading to the stableyard Lan lounged with one boot up on the doorframe,\\ndividing his attention between the kitchen and the yard outside.\\nRand tried to hug the two women and shake Perrin’s hand, all at the same time, and it was a\\ntangle of arms and laughter complicated by Nynaeve trying to feel his face for fever. They looked\\nsomewhat the worse for wear—bruises on Perrin’s face, and he had a way of keeping his eyes\\ndowncast that he had never had before—but they were alive, and together again. His throat was so\\ntight he could barely talk. “I was afraid I’d never see you again,” he managed finally. “I was afraid\\nyou were all. . . .”\\n“I knew you were alive,” Egwene said against his chest. “I always knew it. Always.”\\n“I did not,” Nynaeve said. Her voice was sharp for just that moment, but it softened in the next,\\nand she smiled up at him. “You look well, Rand. Not overfed by any means, but well, thank the\\nLight.”\\n“Well,” Master Gill said behind him, “I guess you know these people after all. Those friends\\nyou were looking for?”\\nRand nodded. “Yes, my friends.” He made introductions all around; it still felt odd to be giving\\nLan and Moiraine their right names. They both eyed him sharply when he did.\\nThe innkeeper greeted everyone with an open smile, but he was properly impressed at meeting a\\nWarder, and especially at Moiraine. At her he gaped openly—it was one thing knowing an Aes Sedai\\nhad been helping the boys, quite something else having her appear in the kitchen—then bowed deeply.\\n“You are welcome to The Queen’s Blessing, Aes Sedai, as my guest. Though I suppose you will be\\nstaying at the Palace with Elaida Sedai, and the Aes Sedai who came with the false Dragon.” Bowing\\nagain, he gave Rand a quick, worried look. It was all very well to say he did not speak ill of Aes\\nSedai, but that was not the same as saying he wanted one sleeping under his roof.\\nRand nodded encouragingly, trying to tell him silently that it was all right. Moiraine was not like\\nElaida, with a threat hidden behind every glance, under every word. \\nAre you sure?

It made a jumble to which\\nMoiraine seemed to pay no attention at all.

But my cats\\ntake care of it. You’ll not be troubled, I promise.”\\nRand exchanged a fleeting look with Perrin, who put his eyes down again right away. There was\\nsomething odd about Perrin’s eyes. And he was so silent; Perrin was almost always slow to speak,\\nbut now he was saying nothing at all. “It could be all the people,” he said.\\n“With your permission, Master Gill,” Moiraine said, as if she took it for granted. “It is a simple\\nmatter to keep rats away from this street. With luck, the rats will not even realize they are being kept\\naway.”\\nMaster Gill frowned at that last, but he bowed, accepting her offer. “If you are sure you don’t\\nwant to stay at the Palace, Aes Sedai.”\\n“Where is Mat?” Nynaeve said suddenly. “\\nShe\\n said he was here, too.”\\n“Upstairs,” Rand said. “He’s . . . not feeling well.”\\nNynaeve’s head came up. “He’s sick?

His eyes were bright and glazed. “You’re burning,” she said, “but\\nyou should not be sweating with this much fever.” She could not keep the worry out of her voice.\\n“Rand, you and Perrin fetch some clean cloths and as much cool water as you can carry. I’ll bring\\nyour temperature down first, Mat, and—”\\n“Pretty Nynaeve,” Mat spat. “A Wisdom isn’t supposed to think of herself as a woman, is she?\\nNot a pretty woman. But you do, don’t you? Now. You can’t make yourself forget that you’re a pretty\\nwoman, now, and it frightens you.

I felt the evil of it when I laid eyes on him, the touch of\\nMashadar, but a Fade could sense it for miles. Even though he would not know exactly where, he\\nwould know it was near, and Mashadar would draw his spirit while his bones remembered that this\\nsame evil swallowed an army—Dreadlords, Fades, Trollocs, and all. Some Darkfriends could\\nprobably feel it, too. Those who have truly given away their souls. There could not help but be those\\nwho would wonder at suddenly feeling this, as if the very air around them itched. They would be\\ncompelled to seek it. It should have drawn them to it as a magnet draws iron filings.”\\n“There were Darkfriends,” Rand said, “more than once, but we got away from them. And a\\nFade, the night before we reached Caemlyn, but he never saw us.” He cleared his throat. “There are\\nrumors of strange things in the night outside the city. It could be Trollocs.”\\n“Oh, it’s Trollocs, sheepherder,” Lan said wryly. “And where Trollocs are, there are Fades.”\\nTendons stood out on the back of his hand from the effort of holding Mat’s wrist, but there was no\\nstrain in his voice. “They’ve tried to hide their passage, but I have seen sign for two days. And heard\\nfarmers and villagers mutter about things in the night. The Myrddraal managed to strike into the Two\\nRivers unseen, somehow, but every day they come closer to those who can send soldiers to hunt them\\ndown. Even so, they won’t stop now, sheepherder.”\\n“But we’re in Caemlyn,” Egwene said. “They can’t get to us as long as—”\\n“They can’t?” the Warder cut her off. “The Fades are building their numbers in the countryside.\\nThat’s plain enough from the sign, if you know what to look for. Already there are more Trollocs than\\nthey need just to watch all the ways out of the city, a dozen fists, at least. There can only be one\\nreason; when the Fades have enough numbers, they will come into the city after you. That act may\\nsend half the armies of the south marching to the Borderlands, but the evidence is that they’re willing\\nto take that risk. You three have escaped them too long. It looks as if you’ve brought a new Trolloc\\nWar to Caemlyn, sheepherder.”\\nEgwene gave a gasping sob, and Perrin shook his head as though to deny it. Rand felt a sickness\\nin his stomach at the thought of Trollocs in the streets of Caemlyn.

What would they do when they\\nsuddenly found Trollocs and Fades in their midst, killing them?

The blade trembled as Mat strained to\\nreach her with it. “This is from Shadar Logoth. There is not a pebble of that city that is not tainted and\\ndangerous to bring outside the walls, and this is far more than a pebble.

Not many travelers used the library; most of those who could read stayed at more elegant inns\\nin the Inner City. Master Gill kept it more for his own enjoyment than for the handful of patrons who\\nwanted a book now and then. Rand did not want to think why Moiraine wanted them to keep out of\\nsight, but he kept remembering the Whitecloak under-officer saying he would be back, and Elaida’s\\neyes when she asked where he was staying. Those were reasons enough, Whatever Moiraine wanted.\\nHe took five steps into the library before he realized that everyone else had stopped, crowded\\ntogether in the doorway, openmouthed and goggling. A brisk blaze crackled in the fireplace, and Loial\\nwas sprawled on the long couch, reading, a small black cat with white feet curled and half asleep on\\nhis stomach. When they entered he closed the book with a huge finger marking his place and gently set\\nthe cat on the floor, then stood to bow formally.\\nRand was so used to the Ogier that it took him a minute to realize that Loial was the object of the\\nothers’ stares. “These are the friends I was waiting for, Loial,” he said. “This is Nynaeve, the\\nWisdom of my village.

I am Loial.”\\n“He’s an Ogier,” Rand explained, and watched their amazement change in kind. Even after\\nTrollocs and Fades in the flesh, it was still astonishing to meet a legend walking and breathing.\\nRemembering his own first reaction to Loial, he grinned ruefully. They were doing better than he had.\\nLoial took their gaping in his stride. Rand supposed he hardly noticed it compared with a mob\\nshouting “Trolloc.” “And the Aes Sedai, Rand?” Loial asked.\\n“Upstairs with Mat.”\\nThe Ogier raised one bushy eyebrow thoughtfully. “Then he \\nis\\n ill.

Are they really havens, the way the stories say?” His voice was intent, as\\nif he had a particular reason for asking.\\nLoial was glad to tell about the \\nstedding,\\n and how he came to be at The Queen’s Blessing, and\\nwhat he had seen in his travels.

Loial liked to talk, and talk at length when he had the slightest chance, though he\\nusually seemed to think a story needed two or three hundred years of background to make it\\nunderstood. His sense of time was very strange; to him three hundred years seemed a reasonable\\nlength of time for a story or explanation to cover.

We’ll all go somewhere they’ve never heard of Aes Sedai or the\\nDark One. Somewhere.\\nThe door opened, and for a moment Rand thought he was still imagining. Mat stood there,\\nblinking, with his coat buttoned up and the dark scarf wrapped low around his forehead. Then Rand\\nsaw Moiraine, with her hand on Mat’s shoulder, and Lan behind them. The Aes Sedai was watching\\nMat carefully, as one watches someone only lately out of a sickbed. As always, Lan was watching\\neverything while appearing to watch nothing.\\nMat looked as if he had never been sick a day. His first, hesitant smile included everyone,\\nthough it slipped into an openmouthed stare at the sight of Loial, as if he were seeing the Ogier for the\\nfirst time. With a shrug and a shake, he turned his attention back to his friends. “I . . . ah . . . that\\nis. . . .” He took a deep breath. “It . . . ah . . . it seems I’ve been acting . . . ah . . . sort of oddly. I don’t\\nremember much of it, really.” He gave Moiraine an uneasy look. She smiled back confidently, and he\\nwent on. “Everything is hazy after Whitebridge. Thom, and the. . . .” He shivered and hurried on. “The\\nfurther from Whitebridge, the hazier it gets. I don’t really remember arriving in Caemlyn at all.” He\\neyed Loial askance. “Not really. Moiraine Sedai says I . . . upstairs, I . . . ah. . . .” He grinned, and\\nsuddenly he truly was the old Mat. “You can’t hold a man to blame for what he does when he’s crazy,\\ncan you?”\\n“You always were crazy,” Perrin said, and for a moment he, too, sounded as of old.\\n“No,” Nynaeve said. Tears made her eyes bright, but she was smiling. “None of us blames you.”\\nRand and Egwene began talking at once then, telling Mat how happy they were to see him well\\nand how well he looked, with a few laughing comments thrown in about hoping that he was done with\\ntricks now that one so ugly had been played on him. Mat met banter with banter as he found a chair\\nwith all of his old swagger. As he sat down, still grinning, he absentmindedly touched his coat as if to\\nmake sure that something tucked behind his belt was still there, and Rand’s breath caught.\\n“Yes,” Moiraine said quietly, “he still has the dagger.” The laughter and talk was still going on\\namong the rest of the Emond’s Field folk, but she had noticed his sudden intake of breath and had seen\\nwhat had caused it. She moved closer to his chair, where she did not have to raise her voice for him\\nto hear clearly. “I cannot take it away from him without killing him. The binding has lasted too long,\\nand grown too strong. That must be unknotted in Tar Valon; it is beyond me, or any lone Aes Sedai,'),\n",

Darkfriends, too, some of them. You said so.”\\n“I have contained that, after a fashion. If they come close enough to sense it now, they will be on\\ntop of us anyway. I cleansed the taint from him, Rand, and did what I could to slow its return, but\\nreturn it will, in time, unless he receives help in Tar Valon.”\\n“A good thing that’s where we’re going, isn’t it?” He thought maybe it was the resignation in his\\nvoice, and the hope for something else, that made her give him a sharp look before turning away.\\nLoial was on his feet, bowing to her. “I am Loial, son of Arent son of Halan, Aes Sedai. The\\nstedding\\n offers sanctuary to the Servants of the Light.”\\n“Thank you, Loial, son of Arent,” Moiraine answered dryly, “but I would not be too free with\\nthat greeting if I were you. There are perhaps twenty Aes Sedai in Caemlyn at this moment, and every\\none but I of the Red Ajah.” Loial nodded sagely, as if he understood. Rand could only shake his head\\nin confusion; he would be Lightblinded if \\nhe\\n knew what she meant. “It is strange to find you here,” the\\nAes Sedai went on. “Few Ogier leave the \\nstedding\\n in recent years.”\\n“The old stories caught me, Aes Sedai. The old books filled my unworthy head with pictures. I\\nwant to see the groves. And the cities we built, too. There do not seem to be many of either still\\nstanding, but if buildings are a poor substitute for trees, they are still worth seeing. The Elders think\\nI’m odd, wanting to travel. I always have, and they always have. None of them believe there is\\nanything worth seeing outside the \\nstedding.\\n Perhaps when I return and tell them what I’ve seen, they\\nwill change their minds. I hope so. In time.”\\n“Perhaps they will,” Moiraine said smoothly. “Now, Loial, you must forgive me for being\\nabrupt. It is a failing of humankind, I know. My companions and I have urgent need to plan our\\njourney. If you could excuse us?”\\nIt was Loial’s turn to look confused. Rand came to his rescue. “He’s coming with us. I promised\\nhim he could.”\\nMoiraine stood looking at the Ogier as if she had not heard, but finally she nodded. “The Wheel\\nweaves as the Wheel wills,” she murmured. “Lan, see that we are not taken unaware.” The Warder\\nvanished from the room, silently but for the click of the door shutting behind him.\\nLan’s disappearance acted like a signal; all talk was cut off. Moiraine moved to the fireplace,\\nand when she turned back to the room every eye was on her. Slight of build as she was, her presence\\ndominated. “We cannot remain long in Caemlyn, nor are we safe here in The Queen’s Blessing. The\\nDark One’s eyes are already in the city. They have not found what they are searching for, or they\\nwould not still be looking. That we have to our advantage. I have set wards to keep them away, and\\nby the time the Dark One realizes that there is a part of the city the rats no longer enter, we will be\\ngone. Any ward that will turn a man aside, though, would be as good as a beacon fire for the\\nMyrddraal, and there are Children of the Light in Caemlyn, also, looking for Perrin and Egwene.”\\nRand made a sound, and Moiraine raised an eyebrow at him.\\n“I thought they were looking for Mat and me,” he said.\\nThe explanation made both the Aes Sedai’s eyebrows lift. “Why would you think the\\nWhitecloaks were looking for you?”\\n“I heard one say they were looking for someone from the Two Rivers. Darkfriends, he said.\\nWhat else was I supposed to think? With everything that’s been happening, I’m lucky I can think at\\nall.”\\n“It has been confusing, I know, Rand,” Loial put in, “but you can think more clearly than that.'),\n",

She said there was no\\nproof I meant any harm and she was going to uphold the law no matter what Elaida suspected.” He\\nshook his head, the memory of Morgase in all her radiance making him forget for a minute that anyone\\nwas looking at him. “Can you imagine me meeting a Queen?

All we met were\\nTinkers and some Whitecloaks.” He avoided looking at Moiraine so obviously that Rand saw the\\navoidance plain. Perrin touched the bruises on his face. “On the whole, singing with the Tinkers was\\nmore fun than the Whitecloaks.”\\n“The Traveling People live for their songs,” Loial said. “For all songs, for that matter. For the\\nsearch for them, at least. I met some Tuatha’an a few years back, and they wanted to learn the songs\\nwe sing to trees. Actually, the trees won’t listen to very many anymore, and so not many Ogier learn\\nthe songs. I have a scrap of that Talent, so Elder Arent insisted I learn. I taught the Tuatha’an what\\nthey could learn, but the trees never listen to humans. For the Traveling People they were only songs,\\nand just as well received for that, since none was the song they seek. That’s what they call the leader\\nof each band, the Seeker. They come to Stedding Shangtai, sometimes. Few humans do.”\\n“If you please, Loial,” Moiraine said, but he cleared his throat suddenly and went on in a quick\\nrumble as if afraid she might stop him.\\n“I’ve just remembered something, Aes Sedai, something I have always wanted to ask an Aes\\nSedai if ever I met one, since you know many things and have great libraries in Tar Valon, and now I\\nhave, of course, and . . . may I?”\\n“If you make it brief,” she said curtly.\\n“Brief,” he said as though wondering what it meant. “Yes. Well. Brief. There was a man came to\\nStedding Shangtai a little time back. This was not unusual in itself, at the time, since a great many\\nrefugees had come to the Spine of the World fleeing what you humans call the Aiel War.” Rand\\ngrinned. A little time back; twenty years, near enough. “He was at the point of death, though there was\\nno wound or mark on him. The Elders thought it might be something Aes Sedai had done”—Loial\\ngave Moiraine an apologetic look—“since as soon as he was within the \\nstedding\\n he quickly got well.\\nA few months.

The Elders said he was as sound in\\nhis mind as in his body, but that was what he said. What I have wanted to ask is, can the Dark One do\\nsuch a thing? Kill time itself? And the Eye of the World?

He did not have to face her alone. “We\\nhave had . . . dreams.” He rubbed the spot on his finger where the thorn had stuck him once,\\nremembering the blood when he woke. Queasily remembering the sunburned feel of his face another\\ntime. “Except maybe they weren’t dreams, exactly. Ba’alzamon was in them.” He knew why Perrin\\nhad used that name; it was easier than saying the Dark One had been in your dreams, inside your head.\\n“He said . . . he said all sorts of things, but once he said the Eye of the World would never serve me.”\\nFor a minute his mouth was as dry as dust.\\n“He told me the same thing,” Perrin said, and Mat sighed heavily, then nodded. Rand found he\\nhad spit in his mouth again. “You aren’t angry with us?” Perrin asked, sounding surprised, and Rand\\nrealized that Moiraine did not seem angry. She was studying them, but her eyes were clear and calm,\\nif intent.\\n“More with myself than you. But I did ask you to tell me if you had strange dreams. In the\\nbeginning, I asked.” Though her voice remained level, a flash of anger crossed her eyes, and was\\ngone in an instant. “Had I known after the first such, I might have been able to. . . . There has not been\\na Dreamwalker in Tar Valon for nearly a thousand years, but I could have tried. Now it is too late.\\nEach time the Dark One touches you, he makes the next touching easier for him. Perhaps my presence\\ncan still shield you somewhat, but even then. . . . Remember the stories of the Forsaken binding men\\nto them? Strong men, men who had fought the Dark One from the start. Those stories are true, and\\nnone of the Forsaken had a tenth of the strength of their master, not Aginor or Lanfear, not Balthamel\\nor Demandred, not even Ishamael, the Betrayer of Hope himself.”'),\n",

Out of the mass\\nof humanity, the Dark One can touch an individual only by chance, unless that person seeks it. But for\\na time, at least, you three are central to the Pattern. A Web of Destiny is being woven, and every\\nthread leads straight to you. What else did the Dark One say to you?”\\n“I don’t remember it all that well,” Perrin said. “There was something about one of us being\\nchosen, something like that. I remember him laughing,” he finished bleakly, “about who we were\\nchosen by. He said I—we could serve him or die. And then we’d still serve him.”\\n“He said the Amyrlin Seat would try to use us,” Mat added, his voice fading as he remembered\\nto whom he was speaking.

He had tried to forget everything about those dreams. It was\\nunpleasant bringing them back. “Yurian Stonebow was another, and Guaire Amalasan.” He stopped\\nsuddenly, hoping Moiraine had not noticed how suddenly. “I don’t recognize any of them.”\\nBut he had recognized one, now that he dredged them from the depths of memory. The name he\\nhad barely stopped himself from saying. Logain. The false Dragon. \\nLight! Thom said they were\\ndangerous names. Is that what Ba’alzamon meant?

This news concerning the Eye of the World changes much.” She\\npaused, frowning. “For a time the Pattern does seem to be swirling around all three of you, just as\\nLoial says, and the swirl will grow greater before it becomes less.

The\\nPattern still weaves itself around you three, but what hand now sets the warp, and what hand controls\\nthe shuttle? Has the Dark One’s prison weakened enough for him to exert that much control?”\\n“There’s no need for that kind of talk!” Nynaeve said sharply. “You’ll only frighten them.”\\n“But not you?” Moiraine asked. “It frightens me. Well, perhaps you are right. Fear cannot be\\nallowed to affect our course. Whether this is a trap or a timely warning, we must do what we must,\\nand that is to reach the Eye of the World quickly. The Green Man must know of this threat.”\\nRand gave a start. \\nThe Green Man?\\n The others stared, too, all but Loial, whose broad face\\nlooked worried.\\n“I cannot even risk stopping in Tar Valon for help,” Moiraine continued. “Time traps us.

If I did not know it was\\nimpossible, I could almost believe the Creator is taking a hand. There is a way.” She smiled as if at a\\nprivate joke, and turned to Loial. “There was an Ogier grove here at Caemlyn, and a Waygate.

What \\nare\\n the Ways?”\\nLoial glanced at Moiraine. She turned away to take a chair in front of the fireplace. The little cat\\nstretched, its claws scratching on the hearthstone, and languidly walked over to butt its head against\\nher ankles. She rubbed behind its ears with one finger. The cat’s purring was a strange counterpoint to\\nthe Aes Sedai’s level voice. “It is your knowledge, Loial. The Ways are the only path to safety for us,\\nthe only path to forestalling the Dark One, if only for a time, but the telling is yours.”\\nThe Ogier did not appear comforted by her speech. He shifted awkwardly on his chair before\\nbeginning. “During the Time of Madness, while the world was still being broken, the earth was in\\nupheaval, and humankind was being scattered like dust on the wind. We Ogier were scattered, too,\\ndriven from the \\nstedding,\\n into the Exile and the Long Wandering, when the Longing was graven on\\nour hearts.” He gave Moiraine another sidelong look. His long eyebrows drew down into two points.\\n“I will try to be brief, but this is not a thing that can be told too briefly. It is of the others I must speak,\\nnow, those few Ogier who held in their \\nstedding\\n while around them the world was tearing apart. And\\nof the Aes Sedai”—he avoided looking at Moiraine, now—“the male Aes Sedai who were dying\\neven as they destroyed the world in their madness. It was to those Aes Sedai—those who had so far\\nmanaged to avoid the madness—that the \\nstedding\\n first made the offer of sanctuary. Many accepted,\\nfor in the \\nstedding\\n they were protected from the taint of the Dark One that was killing their kind. But\\nthey were cut off from the True Source. It was not just that they could not wield the One Power, or\\ntouch the Source; they could no longer even sense that the Source existed. In the end, none could\\naccept that isolation, and one by one they left the \\nstedding,\\n hoping that by that time the taint was gone.\\nIt never was.”\\n“Some in Tar Valon,” Moiraine said quietly, “claim that Ogier sanctuary prolonged the Breaking\\nand made it worse. Others say that if all of those men had been allowed to go mad at once, there\\nwould have been nothing left of the world. I am of the Blue Ajah, Loial; unlike the Red Ajah, we hold\\nto the second view. Sanctuary helped to save what could be saved. Continue, please.”\\nLoial nodded gratefully. Relieved of a concern, Rand realized.\\n“As I was saying,” the Ogier went on, “the Aes Sedai, the male Sedai, left. But before they went,\\nthey gave a gift to the Ogier in thanks for our sanctuary. The Ways. Enter a Waygate, walk for a day,\\nand you may depart through another Waygate a hundred miles from where you started. Or five'),\n",

Different paths, different bridges, lead to\\ndifferent places, and how long it takes to get there depends on which path you take. It was a\\nmarvelous gift, made more so by the times, for the Ways are not part of the world we see around us,\\nnor perhaps of any world outside themselves. Not only did the Ogier so gifted not have to travel\\nthrough the world, where even after the Breaking men fought like animals to live, in order to reach\\nanother \\nstedding,\\n but within the Ways there was no Breaking. The land between two \\nstedding\\n might\\nsplit open into deep canyons or rise in mountain ranges, but in the Way between them there was no\\nchange.\\n“When the last Aes Sedai left the \\nstedding,\\n they gave to the Elders a key, a talisman, that could\\nbe used for growing more. They are a living thing in some fashion, the Ways and the Waygates. I do\\nnot understand it; no Ogier ever has, and even the Aes Sedai have forgotten, I am told. Over the years\\nthe Exile ended for us. As those Ogier who had been gifted by the Aes Sedai found a \\nstedding\\n where\\nOgier had returned from the Long Wandering, they grew a Way to it. With the stonework we learned\\nduring the Exile, we built cities for men, and planted the groves to comfort the Ogier who did the\\nbuilding, so the Longing would not overcome them. To those groves Ways were grown. There was a\\ngrove, and a Waygate, at Mafal Dadaranell, but that city was razed during the Trolloc Wars, no stone\\nleft standing on another, and the grove was chopped down and burned for Trolloc fires.” He left no\\ndoubt which had been the greater crime.\\n“Waygates are all but impossible to destroy,” Moiraine said, “and humankind not much less so.\\nThere are people at Fal Dara still, though not the great city the Ogier built, and the Waygate yet\\nstands.”\\n“How did they make them?” Egwene asked. Her puzzled look took in Moiraine and Loial both.\\n“The Aes Sedai, the men. If they couldn’t use the One Power in a \\nstedding,\\n how could they make the\\nWays? Or did they use the Power at all? Their part of the True Source was tainted. Is tainted. I don’t\\nknow much about what Aes Sedai can do, yet. Maybe it’s a silly question.”\\nLoial explained. “Each \\nstedding\\n has a Waygate on its border, but outside. Your question is not\\nsilly. You’ve found the seed of why we do not dare travel the Ways. No Ogier has used the Ways in\\nmy lifetime, and before. By edict of the Elders, all the Elders of all the \\nstedding,\\n none may, human or\\nOgier.\\n“The Ways were made by men wielding Power fouled by the Dark One. About a thousand years\\nago, during what you humans call the War of the Hundred Years, the Ways began to change. So\\nslowly in the beginning that none really noticed, they grew dank and dim. Then darkness fell along the\\nbridges. Some who went in were never seen again. Travelers spoke of being watched from the dark.\\nThe numbers who vanished grew, and some who came out had gone mad, raving about \\nMachin Shin,\\nthe Black Wind. Aes Sedai Healers could aid some, but even with Aes Sedai help they were never\\nthe same. And they never remembered anything of what had occurred. Yet it was as if the darkness\\nhad sunken into their bones. They never laughed again, and they feared the sound of the wind.”\\nFor a moment there was silence but for the cat purring beside Moiraine’s chair, and the snap and\\ncrackle of the fire, popping out sparks. Then Nynaeve burst out angrily, “And you expect us to follow\\nyou into that? You must be mad!”\\n“Which would you choose instead?” Moiraine asked quietly. “The Whitecloaks within Caemlyn,\\nor the Trollocs without?

Each time we have stood like this, you have thought you could defy me.”\\n“What do mean, each time? I deny you!”\\n“You always do. In the beginning. This contest between us has taken place countless times\\nbefore. Each time your face is different, and your name, but each time it is you.”\\n“I deny you.” It was a desperate whisper.\\n“Each time you throw your puny strength against me, and each time, in the end, you know which\\nof us is the master. Age after Age, you kneel to me, or die wishing you still had strength to kneel. Poor\\nfool, you can never win against me.”\\n“Liar!” he shouted. “Father of Lies. Father of Fools if you can’t do better than that. Men found\\nyou in the last Age, in the Age of Legends, and bound you back where you belong.”\\nBa’alzamon laughed again, peal after mocking peal, until Rand wanted to cover his ears to shut it\\nout. He forced his hands to stay at his sides. Void or no, they were trembling when the laughter finally\\nstopped.\\n“You worm, you know nothing at all. As ignorant as a beetle under a rock, and as easily crushed.\\nThis struggle has gone on since the moment of creation. Always men think it a new war, but it is just\\nthe same war discovered anew. Only now change blows on the winds of time. Change. This time\\nthere will be no drifting back. Those proud Aes Sedai who think to stand you up against me. I will\\ndress them in chains and send them running naked to do my bidding, or stuff their souls into the Pit of\\nDoom to scream for eternity. All but those who already serve me. They will stand but a step beneath\\nme. You can choose to stand with them, with the world groveling at your feet. I offer it one more time,\\none last time. You can stand above them, above every power and dominion but mine. There have been\\ntimes when you made that choice, times when you lived long enough to know your power.”\\nDeny him!\\n Rand grabbed hold to what he could deny. “No Aes Sedai serve you. Another lie!”\\n“Is that what they told you? Two thousand years ago I took my Trollocs across the world, and\\neven among Aes Sedai I found those who knew despair, who knew the world could not stand before\\nShai’tan. For two thousand years the Black Ajah has dwelt among the others, unseen in the shadows.\\nPerhaps even those who claim to help you.”\\nRand shook his head, trying to shake away the doubts that came welling up in him, all the doubts\\nhe had had about Moiraine, about what the Aes Sedai wanted with him, about what she planned for\\nhim. “What do you want from me?” he cried. \\nDeny him! Light help me deny him!\\n“Kneel!” Ba’alzamon pointed to the floor at his feet. “Kneel, and acknowledge me your master!\\nIn the end, you will. You will be my creature, or you will die.”\\nThe last word echoed through the room, reverberating back on itself, doubling and redoubling,\\ntill Rand threw up his arms as if to shield his head from a blow. Staggering back until he thumped into\\nthe table, he shouted, trying to drown the sound in his ears. “Noooooooooooo!”\\nAs he cried out, he spun, sweeping the figures to the floor. Something stabbed his hand, but he\\nignored it, stomping the clay to shapeless smears underfoot. But when his shout failed, the echo was'),\n",

The light dimmed, and his vision narrowed down to a tunnel with Ba’alzamon standing tall in\\nthe last spot of brightness at the end, dwindling until it was the size of his hand, a fingernail, nothing.\\nAround and around the echo whirled him, down into blackness and death.\\nThe thump as he hit the floor woke him, still struggling to swim up out of that darkness. The\\nroom was dark, but not so dark as that. Frantically he tried to center on the flame, to shovel fear into\\nit, but the calm of the void eluded him. Tremors ran down his arms and legs, but he held the image of\\nthe single flame until the blood stopped pounding in his ears.\\nMat was tossing and twisting on his bed, groaning in his sleep. “. . . deny you, deny you, deny\\nyou. . . .” It faded off into unintelligible moans.\\nRand reached out to shake him awake, and at the first touch Mat sat up with a strangled grunt.\\nFor a minute Mat stared around wildly, then drew a long, shuddering breath and dropped his head\\ninto his hands. Abruptly he twisted around, digging under his pillow, then sank back clutching the\\nruby-hilted dagger in both hands on his chest. He turned his head to look at Rand, his face hidden in\\nshadow. “He’s back, Rand.”\\n“I know.”\\nMat nodded. “There were these three figures. . . .”\\n“I saw them, too.”\\n“He knows who I am, Rand. I picked up the one with the dagger, and he said, ‘So that’s who you\\nare.’ And when I looked again, the figure had my face. My face, Rand! It looked like flesh. It felt like\\nflesh. Light help me, I could feel my own hand gripping me, like I was the figure.”\\nRand was silent for a moment. “You have to keep denying him, Mat.”\\n“I did, and he laughed. He kept talking about some eternal war, and saying we’d met like that a\\nthousand times before, and. . . . Light, Rand, the Dark One knows me.”\\n“He said the same thing to me. I don’t think he does,” he added slowly. “I don’t think he knows\\nwhich of us. . . .” \\nWhich of us what?\\nAs he levered himself up, pain stabbed his hand. Making his way to the table, he managed to get\\nthe candle lit after three tries, then spread his hand open in the light. Driven into his palm was a thick\\nsplinter of dark wood, smooth and polished on one side. He stared at it, not breathing. Abruptly he\\nwas panting, plucking at the splinter, fumbling with haste.\\n“What’s the matter?” Mat asked.\\n“Nothing.”\\nFinally he had it, and a sharp yank pulled it free. With a grunt of disgust he dropped it, but the\\ngrunt froze in his throat. As soon as the splinter left his fingers, it vanished.\\nThe wound was still there in his hand, though, bleeding. There was water in the stoneware\\npitcher. He filled the basin, his hands shaking so that he splashed water onto the table. Hurriedly he\\nwashed his hands, kneading his palm till his thumb brought more blood, then washed them again. The\\nthought of the smallest sliver remaining in his flesh terrified him.\\n“Light,” Mat said, “he made me feel dirty, too.” But he still lay where he was, holding the\\ndagger in both hands.\\n“Yes,” Rand said. “Dirty.” He fumbled a towel from the stack beside the basin. There was a\\nknock at the door, and he jumped. It came again. “Yes?” he said.\\nMoiraine put her head into the room. “You are awake already. Good. Dress quickly and come'),\n",

Mat stayed on Rand’s heels as if he were afraid to be even a little alone now, even as\\nmuch as a few feet away. The cook and her helpers straightened, staring as the party passed silently\\ninto the kitchen, already brightly lit and hot with preparations for breakfast. It was not usual for\\npatrons of the inn to be up and out at that hour. At Master Gill’s soothing words, the cook gave a loud\\nsniff and slapped her dough down hard. They were all back to tending griddles and kneading dough\\nbefore Rand reached the stableyard door.\\nOutside, the night was still pitch-black. To Rand, everyone else was only a darker shadow at\\nbest. He followed the innkeeper and Lan blindly, blind in truth, hoping Master Gill’s knowledge of\\nhis own stableyard and the Warder’s instincts would get them across it without someone breaking a\\nleg. Loial stumbled more than once.\\n“I don’t see why we can’t have just one light,” the Ogier grumbled. “We don’t go running about\\nin the dark in the \\nstedding.\\n I’m an Ogier, not a cat.” Rand had a sudden image of Loial’s tufted ears\\ntwitching irritably.\\nThe stable loomed up suddenly out of the night, a threatening mass until the stable door creaked\\nopen, spilling a narrow stream of light into the yard. The innkeeper only opened it wide enough for\\nthem to go in one at a time, and hastily pulled it to behind Perrin, almost clipping his heels. Rand\\nblinked in the sudden light inside.\\nThe stablemen were not surprised by their appearance, as the cook had been. Their horses were\\nsaddled and waiting. Mandarb stood arrogantly, ignoring everyone but Lan, but Aldieb stretched her\\nnose out to nuzzle Moiraine’s hand. There was a pack horse, bulky with wicker panniers, and a huge\\nanimal with hairy fetlocks, taller even than the Warder’s stallion, for Loial. It looked big enough to\\npull a loaded haywain by itself, but compared with the Ogier it seemed a pony.\\nLoial eyed the big horse and muttered doubtfully, “My own feet have always been good enough.”\\nMaster Gill motioned to Rand. The innkeeper was lending him a bay almost the color of his own\\nhair, tall and deep of chest, but with none of the fire in his step that Cloud had had, Rand was glad to\\nsee. Master Gill said his name was Red.\\nEgwene went straight to Bela, and Nynaeve to her long-legged mare.\\nMat brought his dun-colored horse over by Rand. “Perrin’s making me nervous,” he muttered.\\nRand looked at him sharply. “Well, he’s acting strange. Don’t you see it, too? I swear it’s not my\\nimagination, or . . . or. . . .”\\nRand nodded. \\nNot the dagger taking hold of him again, thank the Light.\\n “He is, Mat, but just\\nbe easy. Moiraine knows about . . . Whatever it is. Perrin’s fine.” He wished he could believe it, but'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '../example_data/wot-1.pdf', 'page': 415, 'page_label': '416'}, page_content='it seemed to satisfy Mat, a little at least.\\n“Of course,” Mat said hastily, still watching Perrin out of the corner of his eye. “I never said he\\nwasn’t.”\\nMaster Gill conferred with the head groom. That leathery-skinned man, with a face like one of\\nthe horses, knuckled his forehead and hurried to the back of the stable. The innkeeper turned to\\nMoiraine with a satisfied smile on his round face. “Ramey says the way is clear, Aes Sedai.”\\nThe rear wall of the stable appeared solid and stout, lined with heavy racks of tools. Ramey and\\nanother stableman cleared away the hayforks, rakes, and shovels, then reached behind the racks to\\nmanipulate hidden latches. Abruptly a section of the wall swung inward on hinges so well concealed\\nthat Rand was not sure he could find them even with the disguised door standing open. Light from the\\nstable illuminated a brick wall only a few feet away.\\n“It’s only a narrow run between buildings,” the innkeeper said, “but nobody outside this stable\\nknows there’s a way into it from here. Whitecloaks or white cockades, there’ll not be any watchers to\\nsee where you come out.”\\nThe Aes Sedai nodded. “Remember, good innkeeper, if you fear any trouble from this, write to\\nSheriam Sedai, of the Blue Ajah, in Tar Valon, and she will help. I fear my sisters and I have a good\\ndeal to put right already for those who have helped me.”\\nMaster Gill laughed; not the laugh of a worried man. “Why, Aes Sedai, you’ve already given me\\nthe only inn in all of Caemlyn without any rats. What more could I ask for? I can double my custom on\\nthat alone.” His grin faded into seriousness. “Whatever you’re up to, the Queen holds with Tar Valon,\\nand I hold with the Queen, so I wish you well. The Light illumine you, Aes Sedai. The Light illumine\\nyou all.”\\n“The Light illumine you, also, Master Gill,” Moiraine replied with a bow of her head. “But if\\nthe Light is to shine on any of us, we must be quick.” Briskly she turned to Loial. “Are you ready?”\\nWith a wary look at its teeth, the Ogier took the reins of the big horse. Trying to keep that mouth\\nthe length of the reins from his hand, he led the animal to the opening at the back of the stable. Ramey\\nhopped from one foot to the other, impatient to close it again. For a moment Loial paused with his\\nhead cocked as if feeling a breeze on his cheek. “This way,” he said, and turned down the narrow\\nalley.\\nMoiraine followed right behind Loial’s horse, then Rand, and Mat. Rand had the first turn\\nleading the pack horse. Nynaeve and Egwene made the middle of the column, with Perrin behind\\nthem, and Lan bringing up the rear. The hidden door swung hastily shut as soon as Mandarb stepped\\ninto the dirt alleyway. The \\nsnick-snick\\n of latches locking, shutting them off, sounded unnaturally loud\\nto Rand.\\nThe run, as Master Gill had called it, was very narrow indeed, and even darker than the\\nstableyard, if that was possible. Tall, blank walls of brick or wood lined both sides, with only a\\nnarrow strip of black sky overhead. The big, woven baskets slung on the pack horse scraped the\\nbuildings on both sides. The panniers bulged with supplies for the journey, most of it clay jars filled\\nwith oil. A bundle of poles was lashed lengthwise down the horse’s back, and each had a lantern\\nswinging at the end of it. In the Ways, Loial said, it was darker than the darkest night.\\nThe partially-filled lanterns sloshed with the motion of the horse, and clinked against each other\\nwith a tinny sound. It was not a very loud noise, but in the hour before dawn Caemlyn was quiet.\\nSilent. The dull metallic clinks sounded as if they could be heard a mile away.\\nWhen the run let out into a street, Loial chose his direction without a pause. He seemed to know\\nexactly where he was going, now, as if the route he needed to follow was becoming clearer. Rand did'),\n",

He just knew, he said; he could feel it. Loial claimed it was like trying to explain how to\\nbreathe.\\nAs they hurried up the street Rand looked back toward the corner where The Queen’s Blessing\\nlay. According to Lamgwin, there were still half a dozen Whitecloaks not far down from that corner.\\nTheir interest was all on the inn, but a noise would surely bring them. No one was out at this hour for\\na reputable reason. The horse shoes seemed to ring on the paving stones like bells; the lanterns\\nclattered as if the pack horse were shaking them deliberately. Not until they had rounded another\\ncorner did he stop looking over his shoulder. He heard relieved sighs from the other Emond’s\\nFielders as they came round it, too.\\nLoial appeared to be following the most direct path to the Waygate, wherever it took them.\\nSometimes they trotted down broad avenues, empty save for an occasional dog skulking in the dark.\\nSometimes they hurried along alleys as narrow as the stable run, where things squished under an\\nunwary step. Nynaeve complained softly about the resulting smells, but no one slowed down.\\nThe darkness began to lessen, fading toward a dark gray. Faint glimmers of dawn pearled the sky\\nabove the eastern rooftops. A few people appeared on the streets, bundled up against the early cold,\\nheads down while they yet dreamed of their beds. Most paid no mind to anyone else. Only a handful\\neven glanced at the line of people and horses with Loial at its head, and only one of those truly saw\\nthem.\\nThat one man flicked his eyes at them, just like the others, already sinking back into his own\\nthoughts when suddenly he stumbled and almost fell, turning himself back around to stare. There was\\nonly light enough to see shapes, but that was too much. Seen at a distance by himself, the Ogier could\\nhave passed for a tall man leading an ordinary horse, or for an ordinary man leading an under-sized\\nhorse. With the others in a line behind him to give perspective, Loial looked exactly as big as he was,\\nhalf again as tall as any man should be. The man took one look and, with a strangled cry, set off\\nrunning, his cloak flapping behind him.\\nThere would be more people in the streets soon—very soon. Rand eyed a woman hurrying past\\non the other side of the street, seeing nothing but the pavement in front of her feet. More people to\\nnotice soon. The eastern sky grew lighter.\\n“There,” Loial announced at last. “It is under there.” It was a shop he pointed to, still closed for\\nthe night. The tables out front were bare, the awnings over them rolled up tight, the door stoutly\\nshuttered. The windows above, where the shopkeeper lived, were still dark.\\n“Under?” Mat exclaimed incredulously. “How in the Light can we—?”\\nMoiraine raised a hand that cut him off, and motioned for them to follow her into the alley beside\\nthe shop. Horses and people together, they crowded the opening between the two buildings. Shaded\\nby the walls, it was darker there than on the street, near to full night again.\\n“There must be a cellar door,” Moiraine muttered. “Ah, yes.”\\nAbruptly light blossomed. A coolly glowing ball the size of a man’s fist hung suspended over the\\nAes Sedai’s palm, moving as she moved her hand. Rand thought that it was a measure of what they\\nhad been through that everyone seemed to take it as a matter of course. She put it close to the doors\\nshe had found, slanted almost flat to the ground, with a hasp held by thick bolts and an iron lock\\nbigger than Rand’s hand and thick with old rust.\\nLoial gave the lock a tug. “I can pull it off, hasp and all, but it will make enough noise to wake\\nthe whole neighborhood.”\\n“Let us not damage the goodman’s property if we can avoid it.” Moiraine studied the lock'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '../example_data/wot-1.pdf', 'page': 417, 'page_label': '418'}, page_content='intently for a moment. Suddenly she gave the rusty iron a tap with her staff, and the lock fell open\\nneatly.\\nHastily Loial undid the lock and swung the doors up, propping them back. Moiraine went down\\nthe ramp thus revealed, lighting her way with the glowing ball. Aldieb stepped delicately behind her.\\n“Light the lanterns and come down,” she called softly. “There is plenty of room. Hurry. It will\\nbe light out soon.”\\nRand hurriedly untied the poled lanterns off the pack horse, but even before the first was lit he\\nrealized he could see Mat’s features. People would be filling the streets in minutes, and the\\nshopkeeper would be coming down to open up for business, all wondering why the alleyway was\\ncrammed full of horses. Mat muttered something nervously about taking horses indoors, but Rand was\\nglad to lead his down the ramp. Mat followed, grumbling but no less quickly.\\nRand’s lantern swung on the end of its pole, bumping the ceiling if he was not careful, and\\nneither Red nor the pack horse liked the ramp. Then he was down and getting out of Mat’s way.\\nMoiraine let her floating light die, but as the rest joined them, the added lanterns lit the open space.\\nThe cellar was as long and as wide as the building above, much of the space taken up by brick\\ncolumns, flaring up from narrow bases to five times as big at the ceiling. The place seemed made up\\nfrom a series of arches. There was plenty of room, but Rand still felt crowded. Loial’s head brushed\\nthe ceiling. As the rusted lock had foretold, the cellar had not been used in a long time. The floor was\\nbare except for a few broken barrels filled with odds and ends, and a thick layer of dust. Motes,\\nstirred up by so many feet, sparkled in the lantern light.\\nLan was last in, and as soon as he had Mandarb down the ramp he climbed back to pull the\\ndoors shut.\\n“Blood and ashes,” Mat growled, “why would they build one of these gates in a place like this?”\\n“It was not always like this,” Loial said. His rumbling voice echoed in the cavernous space.\\n“Not always. No!” The Ogier was angry, Rand realized with a shock. “Once trees stood here. Every\\nkind of tree that would grow in this place, every kind of tree that Ogier could coax to grow here. The\\nGreat Trees, a hundred spans high. Shade of branch, and cool breezes to catch the smell of leaf and\\nflower and hold the memory of the peace of the \\nstedding.\\n All that, murdered for this!” His fist\\nthumped a column.\\nThe column seemed to shake under that blow. Rand was certain he heard bricks crack.\\nWaterfalls of dry mortar slid down the column.\\n“What is already woven cannot be undone,” Moiraine said gently. “It will not make the trees\\ngrow again for you to bring the building down on our heads.” Loial’s drooping eyebrows made him\\nlook more abashed than a human face could have managed. “With your help, Loial, perhaps we can\\nkeep the groves that still stand from falling under the Shadow. You have brought us to what we seek.”\\nAs she moved to one of the walls, Rand realized that that wall was different from the others.\\nThey were ordinary brick; this was intricately worked stone, fanciful swirls of leaves and vines, pale\\neven under its coat of dust. The brick and mortar were old, but something about the stone said it had\\nstood there long, long before the brick was fired. Later builders, themselves centuries gone, had\\nincorporated what already stood, and still later men had made it part of a cellar.\\nOne part of the carved stone wall, right in the center, was more elaborate than the rest. As well\\ndone as the rest was, it appeared a crude copy in comparison. Worked in hard stone, those leaves\\nseemed soft, caught in one frozen moment as a gentle summer breeze stirred them. For all of that, they\\nhad the feel of age, as much greater than the rest of the stone as the rest was older than the brick. That\\nold and more. Loial looked at them as if he would rather be anywhere else but there, even out in the'),\n",

Rand\\nscanned the carving; that was the only leaf of its kind he could find. “The leaf of the Tree of Life is\\nthe key,” the Aes Sedai said, and the leaf came away in her hand.\\nRand blinked; from behind him he heard gasps. That leaf had seemed no less a part of the wall\\nthan any other. Just as simply, the Aes Sedai set it against the pattern a handspan lower. The three-\\npointed leaf fit there as if the space had been intended for it, and once more it was a part of the\\nwhole. As soon as it was in place the entire nature of the central stonework changed.\\nHe was sure now that he could see the leaves ruffled by some unfelt breeze; he almost thought\\nthey were verdant under the dust, a tapestry of thick spring greenery there in the lantern-lit cellar.\\nAlmost imperceptibly at first, a split opened up in the middle of the ancient carving, widening as the\\ntwo halves slowly swung into the cellar until they stood straight out. The backs of the gates were\\nworked as the fronts, the same profusion of vines and leaves, almost alive. Behind, where should\\nhave been dirt or the cellar of the next building, a dull, reflective shimmering faintly caught their\\nimages.\\n“I have heard,” Loial said, half mourning, half fearful, “that once the Waygates shone like\\nmirrors. Once, who entered the Ways walked through the sun and the sky. Once.”\\n“We have no time for waiting,” Moiraine said.\\nLan went past her, leading Mandarb, poled lantern in hand. His shadowy reflection approached\\nhim, leading a shadowy horse. Man and reflection seemed to step into each other at the shimmering\\nsurface, and both were gone. For a moment the black stallion balked, an apparently continuous rein\\nconnecting him to the dim shape of his own image. The rein tightened, and the warhorse, too,\\nvanished.\\nFor a minute everyone in the cellar stood staring at the Waygate.\\n“Hurry,” Moiraine urged. “I must be the last through. We cannot leave this open for anyone to\\nfind by chance. Hurry.”\\nWith a heavy sigh Loial strode into the shimmer. Tossing its head, his big horse tried to hold\\nback from the surface and was hauled through. They were gone as completely as the Warder and\\nMandarb.\\nHesitantly, Rand poked his lantern at the Waygate. The lantern sank into its reflection, the two\\nmerging until both were gone. He made himself keep on walking forward, watching the pole\\ndisappear into itself inch by inch, and then he was stepping into himself, entering the gate. His mouth\\nfell open. Something icy slid along his skin, as if he were passing through a wall of cold water. Time\\nstretched out; the cold enveloped one hair at a time, shivered over his clothes thread by thread.\\nAbruptly the chill burst like a bubble, and he paused to catch his breath. He was inside the\\nWays. Just ahead Lan and Loial waited patiently by their horses. All around them was blackness that\\nseemed to stretch on forever. Their lanterns made a small pool of light around them, too small, as if\\nsomething pressed back the light, or ate it.\\nOf a sudden anxious, he jerked at his reins. Red and the pack horse came leaping through, nearly\\nknocking him down. Stumbling, he caught himself and hurried to the Warder and the Ogier, pulling the\\nnervous horses behind him. The animals whickered softly. Even Mandarb appeared to take some\\ncomfort from the presence of other horses.\\n“Go easy when you pass through a Waygate, Rand,” Loial cautioned. “Things are . . . different\\ninside the Ways than out. Look.”\\nHe looked back the way the Ogier pointed, thinking to see the same dull shimmer. Instead he'),\n",

Disturbingly\\nthe darkness around the window into the cellar gave a sense of depth, as though the opening stood\\nalone with nothing around or behind it but the dark. He said as much with a shaky laugh, but Loial\\ntook him seriously.\\n“You could walk all the way around it, and you would not see a thing from the other side. I\\nwould not advise it, though. The books aren’t very clear about what lies behind the Waygates. I think\\nyou could become lost there, and never find your way out.”\\nRand shook his head and tried to concentrate on the Waygate itself rather than what lay behind it,\\nbut that was just as disturbing in its own fashion. If there had been anything to look at in the darkness\\nbesides the Waygate, he would have looked at it. In the cellar, through the smoky dimness, Moiraine\\nand the others were plain enough, but they moved as if in a dream. Every blink of an eye seemed a\\ndeliberate, exaggerated gesture. Mat was making his way to the Waygate as though walking through\\nclear jelly, his legs seeming to swim forward.\\n“The Wheel turns faster in the Ways,” Loial explained. He looked at the darkness surrounding\\nthem, and his head sunk in between his shoulders. “None alive know more than fragments. I fear what\\nI don’t know about the Ways, Rand.”\\n“The Dark One,” Lan said, “cannot be defeated without chancing risks. But we are alive at this\\nmoment, and before us is the hope of remaining alive. Do not surrender before you are beaten, Ogier.”\\n“You would not speak so confidently if you had ever been in the Ways.” The normal distant\\nthunder of Loial’s voice was muted. He stared at the blackness as if he saw things there. “I never\\nhave before, either, but I’ve seen Ogier who have been through a Waygate and come out again. You\\nwould not speak so if you had.”\\nMat stepped through the gate and regained normal speed. For an instant he stared at the\\nseemingly endless darkness, then came running to join them, his lantern bobbing on its pole, his horse\\nleaping behind him, almost sending him sprawling. One by one the others passed through, Perrin and\\nEgwene and Nynaeve, each pausing in shocked silence before hurrying to join the rest. Each lantern\\nenlarged the pool of light, but not as much as it should have. It was as if the dark became denser the\\nmore light there was, thickening as it fought against being diminished.\\nThat was not a line of reasoning Rand wanted to follow. It was bad enough just being there\\nwithout giving the darkness a will of its own. Everyone seemed to feel the oppressiveness, though.\\nThere were no wry comments from Mat here, and Egwene looked as if she wished she could rethink\\nher decision to come.

Yes, Aes Sedai, you are right. Not a minute\\nlonger than need be.” He pointed to a broad strip of white running under their feet, and Rand stepped\\naway from it hastily.

The white line was broken in several\\nplaces. “This leads from the Waygate to the first Guiding.

The horse\\nwore the biggest saddle the head groom had been able to find, but Loial filled it from pommel to\\ncantle.

It was not that he thought there was anything out there\\nagainst which he could use the sword to defend himself; it did not seem as if there was anywhere for\\nsomething to be. The bubble of light around them could as well have been a cave surrounded by\\nstone, completely surrounded, with no way out. The horses might have been walking a treadmill for\\nthe change around them. He gripped the hilt as if the pressure of his hand there could press away the\\nstone he felt weighing down on him. Touching the sword, he could remember Tam’s teaching. For a\\nlittle while he could find the calm of the void. But the weight always returned, compressing the void\\nuntil it was only a cavern inside his mind, and he had to start over again, touching Tam’s sword to\\nremember.\\nIt was a relief when something did change, even if it was only a tall slab of stone, standing on\\nend, that appeared out of the dark before them, the broad white line stopping at its base. Sinuous\\ncurves of metal inlaid the wide surface, graceful lines that vaguely reminded Rand of vines and\\nleaves. Discolored pocks marked stone and metal alike.\\n“The Guiding,” Loial said, and leaned out of his saddle to frown at the cursive metal inlays.\\n“Ogier script,” Moiraine said, “but so broken I can barely make out what it says.”\\n“I hardly can, either,” Loial said, “but enough to know we go this way.” He turned his horse\\naside from the Guiding.\\nThe edges of their light caught other stoneworks, what appeared to be stone-walled bridges\\narcing off into the darkness, and gently sloping ramps, without railings of any kind, leading up and\\ndown. Between the bridges and the ramps ran a chest-high balustrade, however, as though falling was\\na danger there at any rate. Plain white stone made the balustrade, in simple curves and rounds fitted\\ntogether in complex patterns. Something about all of it seemed almost familiar to Rand, but he knew it\\nhad to be his imagination groping for anything familiar where everything was strange.\\nAt the foot of one of the bridges Loial paused to read the single line on the narrow column stone\\nthere.

The guardwall showed cracks and holes, too. In places it was gone altogether\\nfor as much as a span. For all he knew the bridge could be solid stone all the way to the center of the\\nearth, but what he saw made him hope it would stand long enough for them to reach the other end.\\nWherever that is.\\nThe bridge did end, eventually, in a place that looked no different from its beginning. All Rand\\ncould see was what their little pool of light touched, but he had the impression that it was a large\\nspace, like a flat-topped hill, with bridges and ramps leaving all around it.

It\\n can’t \\nbe.\\nLoial consulted yet another slab filled with Ogier script, found another signpost column, led\\nthem onto another bridge. Rand no longer had any idea in what direction they were traveling.\\nIn their huddle of light in the dark, one bridge was exactly like another, except that some had\\nbreaks in the guardwalls and some did not. Only the degree of damage to the Guidings gave any\\ndifference to the Islands. Rand lost track of time; he was not even sure how many bridges they had\\ncrossed or how many ramps they had traveled. The Warder must have had a clock in his head, though.\\nJust when Rand felt the first stir of hunger, Lan announced quietly that it was midday and dismounted\\nto parcel out bread and cheese and dried meat from the pack horse. Perrin was leading the animal by\\nthat time. They were on an Island, and Loial was busily deciphering the directions on the Guiding.\\nMat started to climb down from his saddle, but Moiraine said, “Time is too valuable in the\\nWays to waste.

It was always night there, but not\\nthe kind of night for sleeping. He ate while he rode, though, like everyone else. It was an awkward\\naffair, trying to juggle his food, the lantern pole, and his reins, but for all of his imagined lack of\\nappetite he licked the last crumbs of bread and cheese off his hands when he was done, and thought\\nfondly of more. He even began to think the Ways were not so bad, not nearly as bad as Loial made\\nout. They might have the heavy feel of the hour before a storm, but nothing changed. Nothing\\nhappened. The Ways were almost boring.\\nThen the silence was broken by a startled grunt from Loial. Rand stood in his stirrups to peer\\npast the Ogier, and swallowed hard at what he saw.

There is no rain or wind here, but that\\nstone has been in the air for ten years, at least.” He nodded with a relieved grin, so happy with the\\ndiscovery that for a moment he seemed to forget his fear. Then he looked around and shrugged\\nuncomfortably. “I could find other paths more easily than Mafal Dadaranell. Tar Valon, for instance?\\nOr Stedding Shangtai. It's only three bridges to Stedding Shangtai from the last Island.

It seemed odd to\\nRand that a people so big had such a musical language.\\nFinally the Ogier nodded. As he led them to the chosen bridge, he turned to peer forlornly at the\\nsignpost beside another. “Three crossings to Stedding Shangtai.” He sighed.

All the rest.” Loial looked over his shoulder at the Aes Sedai, talking\\nsoftly with Lan as they rode side-by-side. “What makes you believe it will ever be over?”\\nThe bridges and ramps led up and down and across. Sometimes a white line ran off into the dark\\nfrom the Guiding, just like the line they had followed from the Waygate in Caemlyn. Rand saw that he\\nwas not the only one who eyed those lines curiously, and a little wistfully. Nynaeve, Perrin, Mat, and\\neven Egwene left the lines reluctantly. There was a Waygate at the other end of each of them, a gate\\nback into the world, where there was sky and sun and wind. Even the wind would have been\\nwelcome. Leave them they did, under the Aes Sedai's sharp eye. But Rand was not the only one to\\nlook back even after dark swallowed Island and Guiding and line.\\nRand was yawning by the time Moiraine announced that they would stop for the night on one of\\nthe Islands. Mat looked at the blackness all around them and snickered loudly, but he got down as\\nquickly as anyone else. Lan and the boys unsaddled and hobbled the horses while Nynaeve and\\nEgwene set up a small oil stove to make tea. Looking like the base of a lantern, it was what Lan said\\nWarders used in the Blight, where the wood could be dangerous to burn. The Warder produced tripod\\nlegs from the baskets they took off the pack horse, so the lantern poles could be set in a circle around\\ntheir campsite.\\nLoial examined the Guiding for a moment, then dropped down crosslegged and rubbed a hand\\nacross the dusty, pockmarked stone. “Once things grew on the Islands,” he said sadly. “All the books\\ntell of it. There was green grass to sleep on, soft as any feather bed. Fruit trees to spice the food you'd\\nbrought with an apple or a pear or a bellfruit, sweet and crisp and juicy Whatever the time of year\\noutside.”\\n“Nothing to hunt,” Perrin growled, then looked surprised that he had spoken.\\nEgwene handed Loial a cup of tea. He held it without drinking, staring at it as if he could find the\\nfruit trees in its depths.\\n“Aren't you going to set wards?” Nynaeve asked Moiraine. “Surely there must be worse than rats\\nin this.

The tiny flame of the oil stove gave just enough heat to boil water, but he crouched toward it\\nas if he could soak up warmth. His shoulders brushed Mat and Perrin.

They would have, I think, if a gleeman had been killed.\\nWhitebridge is not so big as for a gleeman to be a small thing. And Thom is a part of the Pattern that\\nweaves itself around you three.

You didn't tell me that, Moiraine Sedai.”\\nRand glanced at her. She was not looking at him, but her tone had been too carefully neutral. “I\\ntalked to her once,” he said. “She dresses like a boy, and her hair is as short as mine.”\\n“You talked to her. Once.” Egwene nodded slowly. Still not looking at him, she raised her cup to\\nher lips.\\n“Min was just somebody who worked at the inn in Baerlon,” Perrin said. “Not like Aram.”\\nEgwene choked on her tea. “Too hot,” she muttered.\\n“Who's Aram?” Rand asked. Perrin smiled, much like Mat's smile in the old days when he was\\nup to mischief, and hid behind his cup.\\n“One of the Traveling People,” Egwene said casually, but red spots bloomed in her cheeks.\\n“One of the Traveling People,” Perrin said blandly. “He dances.

It was like flying with a bird?”\\nEgwene set her cup down deliberately. “I don't know if anyone else is tired, but I'm going to\\nsleep.”\\nAs she rolled herself up in her blankets, Perrin reached over to nudge Rand in the ribs and\\nwinked. Rand found himself grinning back. \\nBurn me, if I didn't come out best for a change. I wish I\\nknew as much about women as Perrin.\\n“Maybe, Rand,” Mat said slyly, “you ought to tell Egwene about Farmer Grinwell's daughter,\\nElse.” Egwene lifted her head to stare first at Mat, then at him.\\nHe hastily got up to fetch his own blankets. “Sleep sounds good to me right now.”\\nAll the Emond's Field people began seeking their blankets then, and Loial, too.

The sound of the wind\\nbecame louder. Rand could hear it even over the pounding of hooves on stone. Behind them, and\\ngusting closer.\\nThey did not bother with the last Guiding. As soon as the light of the lanterns caught the white\\nline running from it, they swung in that direction, still galloping. The Island vanished behind, and\\nthere was only the pitted, gray stone underfoot and the white line. Rand was breathing so hard he was\\nno longer sure if he could hear the wind.\\nOut of the darkness the gates appeared, vine-carved and standing alone in the black like a tiny\\npiece of wall in the night. Moiraine leaned out of her saddle, reaching toward the carvings, and\\nsuddenly pulled back. “The \\nAvendesora\\n leaf is not here!” she said. “The key is gone!”\\n“Light!” Mat shouted. “Bloody light!” Loial threw back his head and gave a mournful cry, like a\\nhowl of dying.\\nEgwene touched Rand's arm. Her lips trembled, but she only looked at him. He put his hand on\\ntop of hers, hoping he did not look more frightened than she did. He felt it. Back toward the Guiding,\\nthe wind howled. He almost thought he could hear voices in it, voices screaming vileness that, even\\nhalf understood, brought bile up in his throat.\\nMoiraine raised her staff and flame lanced from the end of it. It was not the pure, white flame\\nthat Rand remembered from Emond's Field, and the battle before Shadar Logoth. Sickly yellow\\nstreaked through the fire, and slow-drifting flecks of black, like soot. A thin, acrid smoke drifted from\\nthe flame, setting Loial coughing and the horses dancing nervously, but Moiraine thrust it at the gates.\\nThe smoke rasped Rand's throat and burned his nose.\\nStone melted like butter, leaf and vine withering in the flame and vanishing. The Aes Sedai\\nmoved the fire as fast as she could, but cutting an opening big enough for everyone to get through was\\nno quick task. To Rand, it seemed as if the line of melted stone crept along its arc at a snail's pace.\\nHis cloak stirred, as if caught by the edge of a breeze, and his heart froze.\\n“I can feel it,” Mat said, his voice quavering. “Light, I can bloody feel it!”\\nThe flame winked out, and Moiraine lowered her staff. “Done,” she said. “Half done.”\\nA thin line ran across the stone carving. Rand thought he could see light—dim, but still light—\\nthrough the crack. But despite the cutting, the two big, curved wedges of stone still stood there, half an\\narc out of each door. The opening would be big enough for everyone to ride through, though Loial\\nmight have to lie flat on his horse's back. Once the two wedges of stone were gone, it would be big\\nenough. He wondered how much each weighed. A thousand pounds? More? \\nMaybe if we all get\\ndown and push. Maybe we can push one of them over before the wind gets here.\\n A gust tugged at his\\ncloak. He tried not to listen to what the voices cried.\\nAs Moiraine stepped back, Mandarb leaped forward, straight toward the gates, Lan crouched in\\nthe saddle. At the last instant the warhorse twisted to catch the stone with his shoulder, just as he had\\nbeen taught to catch other horses in battle. With a crash the stone toppled outward, and the Warder\\nand his horse were carried by their momentum through the smoky shimmer of a Waygate. The light\\nthat came through was mid-morning light, pale and thin, but it seemed to Rand as if the noonday\\nsummer sun blazed in his face.\\nOn the far side of the gate Lan and Mandarb slowed to a crawl, stumbling in slow motion as the\\nWarder reined back around toward the gate. Rand did not wait. Pushing Bela's head toward the\\nopening, he slapped the shaggy mare hard on the croup. Egwene had just enough time to throw a\\nstartled look over her shoulder at him before Bela carried her out of the Ways.\\n“All of you, out!” Moiraine directed. “Quickly! Go!”\"),\n",

Between the hills and the woods, the\\ntowers often vanished as they rode, only to reappear again when they topped a particularly tall rise.\\nRand noticed trees split open as if struck by lightning.\\n“The cold,” Lan answered when he asked. “Sometimes the winter is so cold here the sap\\nfreezes, and trees burst. There are nights when you can hear them cracking like fireworks, and the air\\nis so sharp you think that might shatter, too. There are more than usual, this winter past.”\\nRand shook his head.

Surely like nothing he could imagine.\\n“Who says winter’s past?” Mat said, his teeth chattering.\\n“Why this, a fine spring, sheepherder,” Lan said. “A fine spring to be alive.

The Blight, where\\nthey were going.\\nHe raised his voice enough to be heard by those close to him. “Nynaeve, maybe you and Egwene\\ndon’t have to go to the Eye with us.” The two women looked at him as if he were speaking gibberish,\\nbut with the Blight so close he had to make one last try. “Maybe it’s enough for you to be close.\\nMoiraine didn’t say you have to go.

For a full mile outside that wall\\nin every direction the ground was clear of anything taller than grass, and that cut low. Nothing could\\ncome close without being seen from one of the many tall towers topped by wooden hoardings. Where\\nthe walls of Caemlyn had a beauty about them, the builders of Fal Dara seemed not to have cared if\\nanyone found their wall beautiful. The gray stone was grimly implacable, proclaiming that it existed\\nfor one purpose alone: to hold. Pennants atop the hoardings whipped in the wind, making the stooping\\nBlack Hawk of Shienar seem to fly all along the walls.\\nLan tossed back the hood of his cloak and, despite the cold, motioned for the others to do the\\nsame.

Once through the gates, Lan swung down out of\\nhis saddle to lead Mandarb, signaling the others to dismount.\\nThe first courtyard was a huge square paved with big stone blocks and surrounded by towers\\nand battlements as fierce as those on the outside of the walls. As big as it was, the courtyard appeared\\njust as crowded as the streets, and as much in turmoil, though there was an order to the crowding\\nhere. Everywhere were armored men and armored horses. At half a dozen smithies around the court,\\nhammers clanged, and big bellows, tugged by two leather-aproned men apiece, made the forge-fires\\nroar. A steady stream of boys ran with new-made horse shoes for the farriers. Fletchers sat making\\narrows, and every time a basket was filled it was whisked away and replaced with an empty one.\\nLiveried grooms appeared on the run, eager and smiling in black-and-gold. Rand hastily untied\\nhis belongings from behind the saddle and gave the bay up to one of the grooms as a man in plate-and-\\nmail and leather bowed formally. He wore a bright yellow cloak edged in red over his armor, with\\nthe Black Hawk on the breast, and a yellow surcoat bearing a gray owl. He wore no helmet and was\\nbareheaded, truly, for his hair had all been shaved except for a topknot tied with a leather cord. “It\\nhas been long, Moiraine Aes Sedai.

Will you raise the Golden Crane banner once more?” The halls were stark except for the wall\\nhangings, and even they used the fewest figures made with the fewest lines necessary to convey\\nmeaning, though in bright colors.\\n“Are things really as bad as they appear, Ingtar?” Lan asked quietly.

Like all the fighting men he had seen, Agelmar’s head was shaved except for a topknot,\\nand that pure white.

A thousand men \\nwill\\n come\\nwhen they hear the Golden Crane flies once more.”\\n“The Seven Towers are broken,” Lan said harshly, “and Malkier is dead; the few of her people\\nleft, scattered across the face of the earth. I am a Warder, Agelmar, sworn to the Flame of Tar Valon,\\nand I am bound into the Blight.”\\n“Of course, Dai Sh—Lan. Of course. But surely a few days’ delay, a few weeks at most, will\\nmake no difference. You are needed. You, and Moiraine Sedai.”\\nMoiraine took a silver goblet from one of the servants. “Ingtar seems to believe you will defeat\\nthis threat as you have defeated many others across the years.”\\n“Aes Sedai,” Agelmar said wryly, “if Ingtar had to ride alone to Tarwin’s Gap, he would ride\\nthe whole way proclaiming that the Trollocs would be turned back once more. He has almost pride\\nenough to believe he \\ncould\\n do it alone.”\\n“He is not as confident as you think, this time, Agelmar.” The Warder held a cup, but he did not\\ndrink. “How bad is it?”\\nAgelmar hesitated, pulling a map from the tangle on the table. He stared unseeing at the map for\\na moment, then tossed it back. “When we ride to the Gap,” he said quietly, “the people will be sent\\nsouth to Fal Moran. Perhaps the capital can hold. Peace, it must. Something must hold.”\\n“That bad?” Lan said, and Agelmar nodded wearily.\\nRand exchanged worried looks with Mat and Perrin. It was easy to believe the Trollocs\\ngathering in the Blight were after him, after them. Agelmar went on grimly.\\n“Kandor, Arafel, Saldaea—the Trollocs raided them all straight through the winter. Nothing like\\nthat has happened since the Trolloc Wars; the raids have never been so fierce, or so large, or pressed\\nhome so hard. Every king and council is sure a great thrust is coming out of the Blight, and every one\\nof the Borderlands believes it is coming at them. None of their scouts, and none of the Warders,\\nreport Trolloc massing above their borders, as we have here, but they believe, and each is afraid to\\nsend fighting men elsewhere. People whisper that the world is ending, that the Dark One is loose\\nagain. Shienar will ride to Tarwin’s Gap alone, and we will be outnumbered at least ten to one. At\\nleast. It may be the last Ingathering of the Lances.\\n“Lan—no!—Dai Shan, for you \\nare\\n a Diademed Battle Lord of Malkier Whatever you say. Dai\\nShan, the Golden Crane banner in the van would put heart into men who know they are riding north to\\ndie. The word will spread like wildfire, and though their kings have told them to hold where they are,\\nlances will come from Arafel and Kandor, and even from Saldaea. Though they cannot come in time\\nto stand with us in the Gap, they may save Shienar.”\\nLan peered into his wine. His face did not change, but wine slopped over his hand; the silver\\ngoblet crumpled in his grip. A servant took the ruined cup and wiped the Warder’s hand with a cloth;\\na second put a fresh goblet in his hand while the other was whisked away. Lan did not seem to notice.\\n“I cannot!” he whispered hoarsely. When he raised his head his blue eyes burned with a fierce light,\\nbut his voice was calm again, and flat. “I am a Warder, Agelmar.” His sharp gaze slid across Rand\\nand Mat and Perrin to Moiraine. “At first light I ride to the Blight.”\\nAgelmar sighed heavily. “Moiraine Sedai, will you not come, at least? An Aes Sedai could'),\n",

You must fight your battle, and we ours.”\\n“You cannot be saying he is loose!” Rocklike Agelmar sounded shaken, and Moiraine quickly\\nshook her head.\\n“Not yet. If we win at the Eye of the World, perhaps not ever again.”\\n“Can you even find the Eye, Aes Sedai? If holding the Dark One depends on that, we might as\\nwell be dead. Many have tried and failed.”\\n“I can find it, Lord Agelmar. Hope is not lost yet.”\\nAgelmar studied her, and then the others. He appeared puzzled by Nynaeve and Egwene; their\\nfarmclothes contrasted sharply with Moiraine’s silk dress, though all were travel-stained. “They are\\nAes Sedai, too?” he asked doubtfully. When Moiraine shook her head, he seemed even more\\nconfused. His gaze ran over the young men from Emond’s Field, settling on Rand, brushing the red-\\nwrapped sword at his waist. “A strange guard you take with you, Aes Sedai. Only one fighting man.”\\nHe glanced at Perrin, and at the axe hanging from his belt. “Perhaps two. But both barely more than\\nlads. Let me send men with you. A hundred lances more or less will make no difference in the Gap,\\nbut you will need more than one Warder and three youths. And two women will not help, unless they\\nare Aiel in disguise. The Blight is worse than usual this year. It—stirs.”\\n“A hundred lances would be too many,” Lan said, “and a thousand not enough. The larger the\\nparty we take into the Blight, the more chance we will attract attention. We must reach the Eye\\nwithout fighting, if we can. You know the outcome is all but foretold when Trollocs force battle\\ninside the Blight.”\\nAgelmar nodded grimly, but he refused to give up. “Fewer, then. Even ten good men would give\\nyou a better chance of escorting Moiraine Sedai and the other two women to the Green Man than will\\njust these young fellows.”\\nRand abruptly realized the Lord of Fal Dara assumed it was Nynaeve and Egwene who with\\nMoiraine would fight against the Dark One. It was natural. That sort of struggle meant using the One\\nPower, and that meant women. \\nThat sort of struggle means using the Power.\\n He tucked his thumbs\\nbehind his sword belt and gripped the buckle hard to keep his hands from shaking.\\n“No men,” Moiraine said. Agelmar opened his mouth again, and she went on before he could\\nspeak. “It is the nature of the Eye, and the nature of the Green Man. How many from Fal Dara have\\never found the Green Man and the Eye?”\\n“Ever?” Agelmar shrugged. “Since the War of the Hundred Years, you could count them on the\\nfingers of one hand. No more than one in five years from all the Borderlands together.”\\n“No one finds the Eye of the World,” Moiraine said, “unless the Green Man wants them to find\\nit. Need is the key, and intention. I know where to go—I have been there before.” Rand’s head\\nwhipped around in surprise; his was not the only one among the Emond’s Fielders, but the Aes Sedai\\ndid not seem to notice. “But one among us seeking glory, seeking to add his name to those four, and\\nwe may never find it though I take us straight to the spot I remember.”\\n“You have seen the Green Man, Moiraine Sedai?” The Lord of Fal Dara sounded impressed, but\\nin the next breath he frowned. “But if you have already met him once. . . .”\\n“Need is the key,” Moiraine said softly, “and there can be no greater need than mine. Than ours.\\nAnd I have something those other seekers have not.”\\nHer eyes barely stirred from Agelmar’s face, but Rand was sure they had drifted toward Loial,'),\n",

As you say, Aes Sedai.”\\nHaving reached a decision, however much he disliked it, the shaven-headed Lord of Fal Dara\\nseemed to put it out of his mind. He invited them to table with him, all the while making conversation\\nabout hawks and horses and dogs, but with never a mention of Trollocs, or Tarwin’s Gap, or the Eye\\nof the World.\\nThe chamber where they ate was as stark and plain as Lord Agelmar’s study had been, with little\\nmore furnishing it than the table and chairs themselves, and they were severe in line and form.\\nBeautiful, but severe. A big fireplace warmed the room, but not so much that a man called out\\nhurriedly would be stunned by the cold outside. Liveried servants brought soup and bread and cheese,\\nand the talk was of books and music until Lord Agelmar realized the Emond’s Field folk were not\\ntalking. Like a good host he asked gently probing questions designed to bring them out of their quiet.\\nRand soon found himself competing to tell about Emond’s Field and the Two Rivers. It was an\\neffort not to say too much. He hoped the others were guarding their tongues, Mat especially. Nynaeve\\nalone held herself back, eating and drinking silently.\\n“There’s a song in the Two Rivers,” Mat said. “ ‘Coming Home From Tarwin’s Gap.’ ” He\\nfinished hesitantly, as if suddenly realizing that he was bringing up what they had been avoiding, but\\nAgelmar handled it smoothly.\\n“Little wonder. Few lands have not sent men to hold back the Blight over the years.”\\nRand looked at Mat and Perrin. Mat silently formed the word Manetheren.\\nAgelmar whispered to one of the servants, and while others cleared the table that man vanished\\nand returned with a canister, and clay pipes for Lan, Loial, and Lord Agelmar. “Two Rivers tabac,”\\nthe Lord of Fal Dara said as they filled their pipes. “Hard to come by, here, but worth the cost.”\\nWhen Loial and the two older men were puffing contentedly, Agelmar glanced at the Ogier.\\n“You seem troubled, Builder. Not beset by the Longing, I hope. How long have you been away from\\nthe \\nstedding\\n?”\\n“It is not the Longing; I have not been gone such a time as that.” Loial shrugged, and the blue-\\ngray streamer rising from his pipe made a spiral above the table as he gestured. “I expected—hoped\\n—that the grove would still be here. Some remnant of Mafal Dadaranell, at least.”\\n“Kiserai ti Wansho,”\\n Agelmar murmured. “The Trolloc Wars left nothing but memories, Loial,\\nson of Arent, and people to build on them. They could not duplicate the Builders’ work, any more\\nthan could I. Those intricate curves and patterns your people create are beyond human eyes and hands\\nto make. Perhaps we wished to avoid a poor imitation that would only have been an ever-present\\nreminder to us of what we had lost.

A stranger tried to enter the town. Not of Shienar. By his accent, a\\nLugarder. Sometimes, at least. When the South Gate guards attempted to question him, he ran away.\\nHe was seen to enter the forest, but only a short time later he was found scaling the wall.”\\n“A small thing!” Agelmar’s chair scraped across the floor as he stood. “Peace! The tower watch\\nis so negligent a man can reach the walls unseen, and you call it a small thing?”\\n“He is a madman, Lord.” Awe touched Ingtar’s voice. “The Light shields madmen. Perhaps the\\nLight cloaked the tower watch’s eyes and allowed him to reach the walls. Surely one poor madman\\ncan do no harm.”\\n“Has he been brought to the keep yet? Good. Bring him to me here. Now.” Ingtar bowed and left,\\nand Agelmar turned to Moiraine. “Your pardon, Aes Sedai, but I must see to this. Perhaps he is only a\\npitiful wretch with his mind blinded by the Light, but. . . . Two days gone, five of our own people\\nwere found in the night trying to saw through the hinges of a horse-gate. Small, but enough to let\\nTrollocs in.” He grimaced. “Darkfriends, I suppose, though I hate to think it of any Shienaran. They\\nwere torn to pieces by the people before the guards could take them, so I’ll never know. If Shienarans\\ncan be Darkfriends, I must be especially careful of outlanders in these days. If you wish to withdraw,\\nI will have you shown to your rooms.”\\n“Darkfriends know neither border nor blood,” Moiraine said. “They are found in every land, and\\nare \\nof\\n none. I, too, am interested in seeing this man. The Pattern is forming a Web, Lord Agelmar, but\\nthe final shape of the Web is not yet set. It may yet entangle the world, or unravel and set the Wheel to\\na new weaving. At this point, even small things can change the shape of the Web. At this point I am\\nwary of small things out of the ordinary.”\\nAgelmar glanced at Nynaeve and Egwene. “As you wish, Aes Sedai.”\\nIngtar returned, with two guards carrying long bills, and escorting a man who looked like a\\nragbag turned inside out. Grime layered his face and matted his scraggly, uncut hair and beard. He\\nhunched into the room, sunken eyes darting this way and that. A rancid smell wafted ahead of him.\\nRand sat forward intently, trying to see through all the dirt.\\n“You’ve no cause to be holding me like this,” the filthy man whined. “I’m only a poor destitute,\\nabandoned by the Light and seeking a place, like everyone else, to shelter from the Shadow.”\\n“The Borderlands are a strange place to seek—” Agelmar began, when Mat cut him off.\\n“The peddler!”\\n“Padan Fain,” Perrin agreed, nodding.\\n“The beggar,” Rand said, suddenly hoarse. He sat back at the sudden hatred that flared in Fain’s\\neyes. “He’s the man who was asking about us in Caemlyn. He has to be.”\\n“So this concerns you after all, Moiraine Sedai,” Agelmar said slowly.\\nMoiraine nodded. “I greatly fear that it does.”'),\n",

He stood upright, not crouching at all. Throwing back his head, he\\nshouted at the ceiling. “Never again! I—will—not!” He faced Agelmar as if the men flanking him\\nwere his own bodyguard and the Lord of Fal Dara his equal rather than his captor. His tone became\\nsleek and oily. “There is a misunderstanding here, Great Lord. I am sometimes taken by spells, but\\nthat will pass soon. Yes, soon I will be rid of them.” Contemptuously he flicked his fingers against the\\nrags he wore. “Do not be misled by these, Great Lord.

He glanced at Moiraine and hurriedly pulled his eyes away from the Aes Sedai.\\nHis gaze ran across the Emond’s Fielders, then jerked back to Agelmar. Rand felt the hate in that\\nlook, and the fear. When Fain spoke again, though, his voice was unruffled. “Padan Fain is simply one\\nof the many disguises I have been forced to wear over the years. Friends of the Dark pursue me, for I\\nhave learned how to defeat the Shadow. I can show you how to defeat him, Great Lord.”\\n“We do as well as men can,” Agelmar said dryly. “The Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills, but\\nwe have fought the Dark One almost since the Breaking of the World without peddlers to teach us\\nhow.”\\n“Great Lord, your might is unquestioned, but can it stand against the Dark One forever? Do you\\nnot often find yourself pressed to hold? Forgive my temerity, Great Lord; he will crush you in the end,\\nas you are. I know; believe me, I do. But I can show you how to scour the Shadow from the land,\\nGreat Lord.” His tone became even more unctuous, though still haughty. “If you but try what I advise,\\nyou will see, Great Lord. You will cleanse the land. You, Great Lord, can do it, if you direct your\\nmight in the right direction. Avoid letting Tar Valon entangle you in its snares, and you can save the\\nworld. Great Lord, you will be the man remembered through history for bringing final victory to the\\nLight.” The guards held their places, but their hands shifted on the long shafts of the bills as if they\\nthought they might have to use them.\\n“He thinks a great deal of himself for a peddler,” Agelmar said to Lan over his shoulder. “I think\\nIngtar is right. He is mad.”\\nFain’s eyes tightened angrily, but his voice remained smooth. “Great Lord, I know my words\\nmust appear grandiose, but if you will only—” He cut off abruptly, stepping back, as Moiraine rose\\nand started slowly around the table.

Not\\neven the High Lords of Tear have older, though the Queen of Andor comes close.” He heaved a sigh,\\nand shook his head. “He will not speak of it, yet the story is well known along the Border. He is a\\nking, or should have been, al’Lan Mandragoran, Lord of the Seven Towers, Lord of the Lakes,\\ncrownless King of the Malkieri.” His shaven head lifted high, and there was a light in his eye as if he\\nfelt a father’s pride. His voice grew stronger, filled with the force of his feeling. The whole room\\ncould hear without straining. “We of Shienar call ourselves Bordermen, but fewer than fifty years\\nago, Shienar was not truly of the Borderlands. North of us, and of Arafel, was Malkier. The lances of\\nShienar rode north, but it was Malkier that held back the Blight. Malkier, Peace favor her memory,\\nand the Light illumine her name.”\\n“Lan is from Malkier,” the Wisdom said softly, looking up. She seemed troubled.\\nIt was not a question, but Agelmar nodded. “Yes, Lady Nynaeve, he is the son of al’Akir\\nMandragoran, last crowned King of the Malkieri. How did he become as he is? The beginning,\\nperhaps, was Lain. On a dare, Lain Mandragoran, the King’s brother, led his lances through the Blight\\nto the Blasted Lands, perhaps to Shayol Ghul itself. Lain’s wife, Breyan, made that dare for the envy\\nthat burned her heart that al’Akir had been raised to the throne instead of Lain. The King and Lain\\nwere as close as brothers could be, as close as twins even after the royal ‘al’ was added to Akir’s\\nname, but jealousy wracked Breyan. Lain was acclaimed for his deeds, and rightfully so, but not even\\nhe could outshine al’Akir. He was, man and king, such as comes once in a hundred years, if that.\\nPeace favor him, and el’Leanna.\\n“Lain died in the Blasted Lands with most of those who followed him, men Malkier could ill\\nafford to lose, and Breyan blamed the King, saying that Shayol Ghul itself would have fallen if\\nal’Akir had led the rest of the Malkieri north with her husband. For revenge, she plotted with Cowin\\nGemallan, called Cowin Fairheart, to seize the throne for her son, Isam. Now Fairheart was a hero\\nalmost as well loved as al’Akir himself, and one of the Great Lords, but when the Great Lords had\\ncast the rods for king, only two separated him from Akir, and he never forgot that two men laying a\\ndifferent color on the Crowning Stone would have set him on the throne instead. Between them,\\nCowin and Breyan moved soldiers back from the Blight to seize the Seven Towers, stripping the\\nBorderforts to bare garrisons.\\n“But Cowin’s jealousy ran deeper.” Disgust tinged Agelmar’s voice. “Fairheart the hero, whose\\nexploits in the Blight were sung throughout the Borderlands, was a Darkfriend. With the Borderforts\\nweakened, Trollocs poured into Malkier like a flood. King al’Akir and Lain together might have\\nrallied the land; they had done so before. But Lain’s doom in the Blasted Lands had shaken the\\npeople, and the Trolloc invasion broke men’s spirit and their will to resist. Too many men.\\nOverwhelming numbers pushed the Malkieri back into the heartland.\\n“Breyan fled with her infant son Isam, and was run down by Trollocs as she rode south with\\nhim.

I can find pity only for the boy.\\nWhen Cowin Fairheart’s treachery was revealed and he was taken by young Jain Charin—already\\ncalled Jain Farstrider—when Fairheart was brought to the Seven Towers in chains, the Great Lords\\ncalled for his head on a pike. But because he had been second only to al’Akir and Lain in the hearts of\\nthe people, the King faced him in single combat and slew him. Al’Akir wept when he killed Cowin.\\nSome say he wept for a friend who had given himself to the Shadow, and some say for Malkier.” The\\nLord of Fal Dara shook his head sadly.\\n“The first peal of the doom of the Seven Towers had been struck.

Into his infant hands\\nthey placed the sword of Malkieri kings, the sword he wears today.

They\\nanointed his head with oil, naming him Dai Shan, a Diademed Battle Lord, and consecrated him as the\\nnext King of the Malkieri, and in his name they swore the ancient oath of Malkieri kings and queens.”\\nAgelmar’s face hardened, and he spoke the words as if he, too, had sworn that oath, or one much\\nsimilar. “To stand against the Shadow so long as iron is hard and stone abides. To defend the\\nMalkieri while one drop of blood remains. To avenge what cannot be defended.” The words rang in\\nthe chamber.\\n“El’Leanna placed a locket around her son’s neck, for remembrance, and the infant, wrapped in\\nswaddling clothes by the Queen’s own hand, was given over to twenty chosen from the King’s\\nBodyguard, the best swordsmen, the most deadly fighters. Their command: to carry the child to Fal\\nMoran.\\n“Then did al’Akir and el’Leanna lead the Malkieri out to face the Shadow one last time. There\\nthey died, at Herat’s Crossing, and the Malkieri died, and the Seven Towers were broken. Shienar,\\nand Arafel, and Kandor, met the Halfmen and the Trollocs at the Stair of Jehaan and threw them back,\\nbut not as far as they had been. Most of Malkier remained in Trolloc hands, and year by year, mile by\\nmile, the Blight has swallowed it.” Agelmar drew a heavyhearted breath. When he went on, there was\\na sad pride in his eyes and voice.\\n“Only five of the Bodyguards reached Fal Moran alive, every man wounded, but they had the\\nchild unharmed. From the cradle they taught him all they knew. He learned weapons as other children\\nlearn toys, and the Blight as other children their mother’s garden.

Moiraine directed\\nhim to put them on the table. “Your pardon for commanding your servants, Lord Agelmar,” she said.\\n“I took the liberty of asking for this.”\\nAgelmar nodded to the servant, who put the tray on the table and left hurriedly. “My servants are\\nyours to command, Aes Sedai.”'),\n",

Like a steel snake undulating to mounted\\nkettledrums, the column wound its way out of the town four abreast, Agelmar at its head hidden in the\\nforest before its tail left Fal Dara keep. There were no cheers in the streets to speed them on their\\nway, only their own drums and their pennants’ cracking in the wind, but their eyes looked toward the\\nrising sun with purpose.

He still wore his shifting cloak,\\nas if heat made no more impression on him than cold; it almost made his angular face seem to float\\nunsupported above Mandarb’s back. “Flowers can kill in the Blight, and leaves maim. There’s a little\\nthing called a Stick that likes to hide where the leaves are thickest, looking like its name, waiting for\\nsomething to touch it. When something does, it bites. Not poison. The juice begins to digest the\\nStick’s prey for it. The only thing that can save you is to cut off the arm or leg that was bitten. But a\\nStick won’t bite unless you touch it. Other things in the Blight will.”\\nRand jerked his hand back, leaves untouched, and wiped it on his pants leg.\\n“Then we’re in the Blight?” Perrin said. Strangely, he did not sound frightened.\\n“Just the fringe,” Lan said grimly. His stallion kept moving forward, and he spoke over his\\nshoulder. “The real Blight still lies ahead. There are things in the Blight that hunt by sound, and some\\nmay have wandered this far south. Sometimes they cross the Mountains of Dhoom. Much worse than\\nSticks. Keep quiet and keep up, if you want to stay alive.” He continued to set a hard pace, not\\nwaiting for an answer.'),\n",

Leaves covered the trees in\\never greater profusion, but stained and spotted with yellow and black, with livid red streaks like\\nblood poisoning. Every leaf and creeper seemed bloated, ready to burst at a touch. Flowers hung on\\ntrees and weeds in a parody of spring, sickly pale and pulpy, waxen things that appeared to be rotting\\nwhile Rand watched. When he breathed through his nose, the sweet stench of decay, heavy and thick,\\nsickened him; when he tried breathing through his mouth, he almost gagged. The air tasted like a\\nmouthful of spoiled meat. The horses’ hooves made a soft squishing as rotten-ripe things broke open\\nunder them.\\nMat leaned out of his saddle and spewed until his stomach was empty. Rand sought the void, but\\ncalmness was little help against the burning bile that kept creeping up his throat. Empty or not, Mat\\nheaved again a mile later, bringing up nothing, and yet again after that. Egwene looked as if she\\nwanted to be sick, too, swallowing constantly, and Nynaeve’s face was a white mask of\\ndetermination, her jaw set and her eyes fixed on Moiraine’s back. The Wisdom would not admit to\\nfeeling ill unless the Aes Sedai did, first, but Rand did not think she would have to wait long.\\nMoiraine’s eyes were tight, and her lips pale.\\nDespite the heat and damp, Loial wrapped a scarf around his nose and mouth. When he met\\nRand’s gaze, the Ogier’s outrage and disgust were plain in his eyes. “I had heard—” he began, his\\nvoice muffled by the wool, then stopped to clear his throat with a grimace. “Faugh! It tastes like. . . .\\nFaugh! I had heard and read about the Blight, but nothing could describe. . . .” His gesture somehow\\ntook in the smell as well as the eye-sickening growth. “That even the Dark One should do this to\\ntrees! Faugh!”\\nThe Warder was not affected, of course, at least not that Rand could see, but to his surprise\\nneither was Perrin. Or rather, not in the way the rest of them were. The big youth glared at the\\nobscene forest through which they rode as he might have at an enemy, or the banner of an enemy. He\\ncaressed the axe at his belt as if unaware of what he was doing, and muttered to himself, half\\ngrowling in a way that made the hair on Rand’s neck stir. Even in full sunlight his eyes glowed,\\ngolden and fierce.\\nThe heat did not abate as the bloody sun fell toward the horizon. In the distance to the north,\\nmountains rose, higher than the Mountains of Mist, black against the sky. Sometimes an icy wind from\\nthe sharp peaks gusted far enough to reach them. The torrid humidity leached away most of the\\nmountain chill, but what remained was winter-cold compared to the swelter it replaced, if just for a\\nmoment. The sweat on Rand’s face seemed to flash into beads of ice; as the wind died, the beads\\nmelted again, running angry lines down his cheeks, and the thick heat returned harder than before by\\ncomparison. For the instant the wind surrounded them, it swept away the fetor, yet he would have\\ndone without that, too, if he could have. The cold was the chill of the grave, and it carried the dusty\\nmust of an old tomb newly opened.\\n“We cannot reach the mountains by nightfall,” Lan said, “and it is dangerous to move at night,\\neven for a Warder alone.”\\n“There is a place not far off,” Moiraine said. “It will be a good omen for us to camp there.”\\nThe Warder gave her a flat look, then nodded reluctantly. “Yes. We must camp somewhere. It\\nmight as well be there.”\\n“The Eye of the World was beyond the high passes when I found it,” Moiraine said. “Better to\\ncross the Mountains of Dhoom in full daylight, at noon, when the Dark One’s powers in this world are\\nweakest.”\\n“You talk as if the Eye isn’t always in the same place.” Egwene spoke to the Aes Sedai, but it'),\n",

The Green Man seems to be\\nfound where he is needed. But it has always been beyond the high passes. They are treacherous, the\\nhigh passes, and haunted by creatures of the Dark One.”\\n“We must reach the passes before we need worry about them,” Lan said. “Tomorrow we will be\\ntruly into the Blight.”\\nRand looked at the forest around him, every leaf and flower diseased, every creeper decaying as\\nit grew, and he could not repress a shudder. \\nIf this isn’t truly the Blight, what is?\\nLan turned them westward, at an angle to the sinking sun. The Warder maintained the pace he\\nhad set before, but there was reluctance in the set of his shoulders.\\nThe sun was a sullen red ball just touching the treetops when they crested a hill and the Warder\\ndrew rein. Beyond them to the west lay a network of lakes, the waters glittering darkly in the slanting\\nsunlight, like beads of random size on a necklace of many strings. In the distance, circled by the lakes,\\nstood jagged-topped hills, thick in the creeping shadows of evening. For one brief instant the sun’s\\nrays caught the shattered tops, and Rand’s breath stilled. Not hills. The broken remnants of seven\\ntowers. He was not sure if anyone else had seen it; the sight was gone as quickly as it came. The\\nWarder was dismounting, his face as lacking in emotion as a stone.\\n“Couldn’t we camp down by the lakes?” Nynaeve asked, patting her face with her kerchief. “It\\nmust be cooler down by the water.”\\n“Light,” Mat said, “I’d just like to stick my head in one of them. I might never take it out.”\\nJust then something roiled the waters of the nearest lake, the dark water phosphorescing as a\\nhuge body rolled beneath the surface. Length on man-thick length sent ripples spreading, rolling on\\nand on until at last a tail rose, waving a point like a wasp’s stinger for an instant in the twilight, at\\nleast five spans into the air. All along that length fat tentacles writhed like monstrous worms, as many\\nas a centipede’s legs. It slid slowly beneath the surface and was gone, only the fading ripples to say it\\nhad ever been.\\nRand closed his mouth and exchanged a look with Perrin. Perrin’s yellow eyes were as\\ndisbelieving as he knew his own must be. Nothing that big could live in a lake that size. \\nThose\\ncouldn’t have been\\n hands \\non those tentacles. They couldn’t have been.\\n“On second thought,” Mat said faintly, “I like it right here just fine.”\\n“I will set guarding wards around this hill,” Moiraine said. She had already dismounted from\\nAldieb. “A true barrier would draw the attention we do not want like flies to honey, but if any\\ncreation of the Dark One or anything that serves the Shadow comes within a mile of us, I will know.”\\n“I’d be happier with the barrier,” Mat said as his boots touched the ground, “just as long as it\\nkept that, that . . . thing on the other side.”\\n“Oh, do be quiet, Mat,” Egwene said curtly, at the same time as Nynaeve spoke. “And have them\\nwaiting for us when we leave in the morning? You \\nare\\n a fool, Matrim Cauthon.” Mat glowered at the\\ntwo women as they climbed down, but he kept his mouth shut.\\nAs he took Bela’s reins, Rand shared a grin with Perrin. For a moment it was almost like being\\nhome, having Mat saying what he should not at the worst possible time. Then the smile faded from\\nPerrin’s face; in the twilight his eyes \\ndid\\n glow, as if they had a yellow light behind them. Rand’s grin\\nslipped away, too. \\nIt isn’t like home at all.\\nRand and Mat and Perrin helped Lan unsaddle and hobble the horses while the others began\\nsetting up the camp.

The Ogier and the women were gone. So\\nwas the stove and all the wicker panniers from the pack horse. The hilltop was empty except for\\nevening shadows.\\nWith a numb hand he fumbled for his sword, dimly hearing Mat curse. Perrin had his axe out, his\\nshaggy head swiveling to find the danger.\\n“Sheepherders,” Lan muttered. Unconcernedly the Warder strode across the hilltop, and at his\\nthird step, he vanished.\\nRand exchanged wide-eyed looks with Mat and Perrin, and then they were all darting for where\\nthe Warder had disappeared. Abruptly Rand skidded to a halt, taking another step when Mat ran into\\nhis back. Egwene looked up from setting the kettle atop the tiny stove. Nynaeve was closing the\\nmantle on a second lit lantern. They were all there, Moiraine sitting cross-legged, Lan lounging on an\\nelbow, Loial taking a book out of his pack.\\nCautiously Rand looked behind him. The hillside was there as it had been, the shadowed trees,\\nthe lakes beyond sinking into darkness. He was afraid to step back, afraid they would all disappear\\nagain and perhaps this time he would not be able to find them. Edging carefully around him, Perrin let\\nout a long breath.\\nMoiraine noticed the three of them standing there, gaping. Perrin looked abashed, and slipped\\nhis axe back into the heavy belt loop as if he thought no one might notice. A smile touched her lips. “It\\nis a simple thing,” she said, “a bending, so any eye looking at us sees around us, instead. We cannot\\nhave the eyes that will be out there seeing our lights tonight, and the Blight is no place to be in the\\ndark.”\\n“Moiraine Sedai says I might be able to do it.” Egwene’s eyes were bright. “She says I can\\nhandle enough of the One Power right now.”\\n“Not without training, child,” Moiraine cautioned. “The simplest matter concerning the One\\nPower can be dangerous to the untrained, and to those around them.” Perrin snorted, and Egwene\\nlooked so uncomfortable that Rand wondered if she had already been trying her abilities.\\nNynaeve set down the lantern. Together with the tiny flame of the stove, the pair of lanterns gave\\na generous light. “When you go to Tar Valon, Egwene,” she said carefully, “perhaps I’ll go with you.”\\nThe look she gave Moiraine was strangely defensive. “It will do her good to see a familiar face\\namong strangers. She’ll need someone to advise her besides Aes Sedai.”\\n“Perhaps that would be for the best, Wisdom,” Moiraine said simply.\\nEgwene laughed and clapped her hands. “Oh, that \\nwill\\n be wonderful. And you, Rand. You’ll\\ncome, too, won’t you?” He paused in the act of sitting across the stove from her, then slowly lowered\\nhimself. He thought her eyes had never been bigger, or brighter, or more like pools that he could lose\\nhimself in. Spots of color appeared in her cheeks, and she gave a smaller laugh. “Perrin, Mat, you\\ntwo will come, won’t you? We’ll all be together.” Mat gave a grunt that could have signified\\nanything, and Perrin only shrugged, but she took it for assent. “You see, Rand.

The moon gave a wavering, watery light, but the sun might\\nhave been at its zenith for all the cool the night had.\\nRand found sleep impossible, even with the Aes Sedai stretched out not a span away to shield\\nhis dreams. It was the thick air that kept him awake. Loial’s soft snores were a rumble that made\\nPerrin’s seem nonexistent, but they did not stop weariness from claiming the others. The Warder was\\nstill awake, seated not far from him with his sword across his knees, watching the night. To Rand’s\\nsurprise, so was Nynaeve.\\nThe Wisdom looked at Lan silently for a long time, then poured a cup of tea and brought it to\\nhim. When he reached out with a murmur of thanks, she did not let go right away. “I should have\\nknown you would be a king,” she said quietly. Her eyes were steady on the Warder’s face, but her\\nvoice trembled slightly.\\nLan looked back at her just as intently. It seemed to Rand that the Warder’s face actually\\nsoftened. “I am not a king, Nynaeve. Just a man. A man without as much to his name as even the\\nmeanest farmer’s croft.”\\nNynaeve’s voice steadied. “Some women don’t ask for land, or gold. Just the man.”\\n“And the man who would ask her to accept so little would not be worthy of her. You are a\\nremarkable woman, as beautiful as the sunrise, as fierce as a warrior. You are a lioness, Wisdom.”\\n“A Wisdom seldom weds.” She paused to take a deep breath, as if steeling herself. “But if I go\\nto Tar Valon, it may be that I will be something other than a Wisdom.”\\n“Aes Sedai marry as seldom as Wisdoms. Few men can live with so much power in a wife,\\ndimming them by her radiance whether she wishes to or not.”\\n“Some men are strong enough. I know one such.” If there could have been any doubt, her look\\nleft none as to whom she meant.\\n“All I have is a sword, and a war I cannot win, but can never stop fighting.”\\n“I’ve told you I care nothing for that. Light, you’ve made me say more than is proper already.\\nWill you shame me to the point of asking you?”\\n“I will never shame you.” The gentle tone, like a caress, sounded odd to Rand’s ears in the\\nWarder’s voice, but it made Nynaeve’s eyes brighten. “I will hate the man you choose because he is\\nnot me, and love him if he makes you smile. No woman deserves the sure knowledge of widow’s\\nblack as her brideprice, you least of all.” He set the untouched cup on the ground and rose. “I must\\ncheck the horses.”\\nNynaeve remained there, kneeling, after he had gone.\\nSleep or no, Rand closed his eyes.

Even\\nhere, that, at least, was untouched.\\nHe was surprised to realize that he had slept. For a minute the dim memory of a conversation\\noverheard seemed like part of some dream. Then he saw Nynaeve’s red-rimmed eyes; she had not\\nslept, obviously. Lan’s face was harder than ever, as if he had resumed a mask and did not intend to\\nlet it slip again.\\nEgwene went over and crouched beside the Wisdom, her face concerned. He could not make out\\nwhat they said. Egwene spoke, and Nynaeve shook her head. Egwene said something else, and the\\nWisdom waved her away dismissively. Instead of going, Egwene bent her head closer, and for a few\\nminutes the two women talked even more softly, with Nynaeve still shaking her head. The Wisdom\\nended it with a laugh, hugging Egwene and, by her expression, making soothing talk. When Egwene\\nstood, though, she glared at the Warder. Lan did not seem to notice; he did not look in Nynaeve’s\\ndirection at all.\\nShaking his head, Rand gathered his things, and gave his hands and face and teeth a hasty wash\\nwith the little water Lan allowed for such things.

He was sure there was something in the silent exchange that he should\\nunderstand, but that feather-light brush across his mind vanished before he could grasp it.\\n“What are we waiting for?” Mat demanded, the low band of his scarf across his forehead.

Even under the sunrise the peaks rose black and\\nlifeless, like jagged teeth. In a wall they stretched, east and west as far as the eye could see.\\n“Will we reach the Eye today, Moiraine Sedai?” Egwene asked.\\nThe Aes Sedai gave Loial a sidelong look. “I hope that we will. When I found it before, it was\\njust the other side of the mountains, at the foot of the high passes.”\\n“He says it moves,” Mat said, nodding at Loial. “What if it isn’t where you expect?”\\n“Then we will continue to hunt until we do find it. The Green Man senses need, and there can be\\nno need greater than ours. Our need is the hope of the world.”\\nAs the mountains drew closer, so did the true Blight. Where a leaf had been spotted black and\\nmottled yellow before, now foliage fell wetly while he watched, breaking apart from the weight of its\\nown corruption. The trees themselves were tortured, crippled things, twisted branches clawing at the\\nsky as if begging mercy from some power that refused to hear. Ooze slid like pus from bark cracked\\nand split. As if nothing truly solid was left to them, the trees seemed to tremble from the passage of\\nthe horses over the ground.\\n“Look as if they want to grab us,” Mat said nervously. Nynaeve gave him an exasperated,\\nscornful look, and he added fiercely, “Well, they do look it.”\\n“And some of them do want it,” the Aes Sedai said. Her eyes over her shoulder were harder than\\nLan’s for an instant. “But they want no part of what I am, and my presence protects you.”\\nMat laughed uneasily, as if he thought it a joke on her part.\\nRand was not so sure. This \\nwas\\n the Blight, after all. \\nBut trees don’t move. Why would a tree\\ngrab a man, even if it could? We’re imagining things, and she’s just trying to keep us alert.\\nAbruptly he stared off to his left, into the forest. That tree, not twenty paces away, \\nhad\\n trembled,\\nand it was none of his imagination. He could not say what kind it was, or had been, so gnarled and\\ntormented was its shape.

Abruptly it was gone.\\n“Lan can look after himself,” Moiraine said. “Ride, Wisdom.”\\nFrom out of the trees the Warder appeared, holding his sword well clear of himself and his\\nmount.

Stiff hair like long bristles covered it, and it had too many\\nlegs, joining a body as big as a bear at odd angles. Some of them at least, those coming out of its\\nback, had to be useless for walking, but the finger-long claws at their ends tore the earth in its death\\nagony.\\n“Good shooting, sheepherder.” Lan’s eyes had already forgotten what was dying behind them,\\nand were searching the forest.\\nMoiraine shook her head. “It should not have been willing to come so close to one who touches\\nthe True Source.”\\n“Agelmar said the Blight stirs,” Lan said. “Perhaps the Blight also knows a Web is forming in\\nthe Pattern.”\\n“Hurry.” Moiraine dug her heels into Aldieb’s flanks. “We must get over the high passes\\nquickly.”\\nBut even as she spoke the Blight rose against them. Trees whipped in, reaching for them, not\\ncaring if Moiraine touched the True Source or not.\\nRand’s sword was in his hand; he did not remember unsheathing it. He struck out again and\\nagain, the heron-mark blade slicing through corrupted limbs.

Teeth bared in a rictus snarl, he sought the\\nvoid, and found it in the stony, stubborn soil of the Two Rivers. “Manetheren!” He screamed back at\\nthe trees till his throat ached. The heron-mark steel flashed in the strengthless sunlight. “Manetheren!\\nManetheren!”\\nStanding in his stirrups, Mat sent arrow after arrow flashing into the forest, striking at deformed\\nshapes that snarled and gnashed uncounted teeth on the shafts that killed them, bit at the clawed forms\\nfighting to get over them, to reach the mounted figures.

Trees of the\\nkinds that had earlier attacked did not so much as twitch even when they rode directly under the\\ntwisted branches. The Mountains of Dhoom filled the sky ahead, black and bleak, and almost near\\nenough to touch, it seemed. The piping came both sharp and clear, and there were squishing sounds\\nbehind them, louder than the things crushed under hooves. Too loud, as if half-decayed trees were\\nbeing crushed by huge bodies slithering over them. Too near. Rand looked over his shoulder. Back'),\n",

Between one slope of a hill and the next, between crest\\nand peak, the Blight was gone.\\nGreen leaves covered peacefully spreading branches. Wildflowers made a carpet of bright\\npatches in grasses stirred by a sweet spring breeze. Butterflies fluttered from blossom to blossom,\\nwith buzzing bees, and birds trilled their songs.\\nGaping, he galloped on, until he suddenly realized that Moiraine and Lan and Loial had stopped,\\nthe others, too. Slowly he drew rein, his face frozen in astonishment. Egwene’s eyes were about to\\ncome out of her head, and Nynaeve’s jaw had dropped.\\n“We have reached safety,” Moiraine said. “This is the Green Man’s place, and the Eye of the\\nWorld is here. Nothing of the Blight can enter here.”\\n“I thought it was on the other side of the mountains,” Rand mumbled. He could still see the peaks\\nfilling the northern horizon, and the high passes. “You said it was always beyond the passes.”\\n“This place,” said a deep voice from the trees, “is always where it is. All that changes is where\\nthose who need it are.”\\nA figure stepped out of the foliage, a man-shape as much bigger than Loial as the Ogier was\\nbigger than Rand. A man-shape of woven vines and leaves, green and growing. His hair was grass,\\nflowing to his shoulders; his eyes, huge hazelnuts; his fingernails, acorns. Green leaves made his tunic\\nand trousers; seamless bark, his boots. Butterflies swirled around him, lighting on his fingers, his\\nshoulders, his face. Only one thing spoiled the verdant perfection. A deep fissure ran up his cheek and\\ntemple across the top of his head, and in that the vines were brown and withered.\\n“The Green Man,” Egwene whispered, and the scarred face smiled. For a moment it seemed as\\nif the birds sang louder.\\n“Of course I am. Who else would be here?” The hazelnut eyes regarded Loial. “It is good to see\\nyou, little brother.

Do the old times truly\\nwalk again then?”\\nRand stared at Perrin. For his part, Perrin turned his horse so it was between him and the Green\\nMan, and bent to check the girth. Rand was sure he just wanted to avoid the Green Man’s searching\\ngaze. Suddenly the Green Man spoke to Rand.\\n“Strange clothes you wear, Child of the Dragon. Has the Wheel turned so far? Do the People of\\nthe Dragon return to the first Covenant? But you wear a sword.

You, Moiraine\\nSedai, are more than a surprise. When this place was made, it was made so that none could find it\\ntwice. How have you come here?”\\n“Need,” Moiraine replied. “My need, the world’s need. Most of all is the world’s need. We\\nhave come to see the Eye of the World.”\\nThe Green Man sighed, the wind sighing through thick-leafed branches. “Then it has come again.\\nThat memory remains whole. The Dark One stirs.

But after the Blight, the trees and flowers would have been a\\nwonder of normality even if the rest of the world was not still trapped in winter.\\nPerrin hung a little to the rear.

He could understand that. \\nChild of the\\nDragon.\\n Warily he watched the Green Man, walking ahead with Moiraine and Lan, butterflies\\nsurrounding him in a cloud of yellows and reds. \\nWhat did he mean? No. I don’t want to know.\\nEven so, his step felt lighter, his legs springier. The uneasiness still lay in his gut, churning his\\nstomach, but the fear had become so diffuse it might as well be gone. He did not think he could expect\\nmore, not with the Blight half a mile away, even if Moiraine was right about nothing from the Blight\\nbeing able to enter here. The thousands of burning points piercing his bones had winked out; at the\\nvery moment he came within the Green Man’s domain, he was sure. \\nIt’s him that winked them out,\\n he\\nthought, \\nthe Green Man, and this place.\\nEgwene felt it, and Nynaeve, too, the soothing peace, the calm of beauty. He could tell. They\\nwore small, serene smiles, and brushed flowers with their fingers, pausing to smell, and breathing\\ndeep.\\nWhen the Green Man noticed, he said, “Flowers are meant to adorn. The plants or humans, it is\\nmuch the same. None mind, so long as you don’t take too many.” And he began plucking one from this\\nplant and one from that, never more than two from any. Soon Nynaeve and Egwene wore caps of\\nblossoms in their hair, pink wildrose and yellowbell and white morningstar. The Wisdom’s braid\\nseemed a garden of pink and white to her waist. Even Moiraine received a pale garland of\\nmorningstar on her brow, woven so deftly that the flowers still seemed to be growing.\\nRand was not sure they were not growing. The Green Man tended his forest garden as he\\nwalked, while he talked softly to Moiraine, taking care of Whatever needed care without really\\nthinking about it. His hazelnut eyes caught a crooked limb on a climbing wildrose, forced into an\\nawkward angle by the blossom-covered limb of an apple tree, and he paused, still talking, to run his\\nhand along the bend. Rand was not sure if his eyes were playing tricks, or if thorns actually did bend\\nout of the way so as not to prick those green fingers. When the towering shape of the Green Man\\nmoved on, the limb ran straight and true, spreading red petals among the white of apple blossoms.

She was so pretty, with her unbound hair full of flowers, that he\\nsmiled back at her until she blushed and lowered her eyes. \\nI will protect you,\\n he thought. \\nWhatever\\nelse happens, I will see you safe, I swear it.\\nInto the heart of the spring forest the Green Man took them, to an arched opening in the side of a\\nhill. It was a simple stone arch, tall and white, and on the keystone was a circle halved by a sinuous\\nline, one half rough, the other smooth. The ancient symbol of Aes Sedai. The opening itself was\\nshadowed.\\nFor a moment everyone simply looked in silence. Then Moiraine removed the garland from her\\nhair and gently hung it on the limb of a sweetberry bush beside the arch. It was as if her movement\\nrestored speech.\\n“It’s in there?” Nynaeve asked. “What we’ve come for?”\\n“I’d really like to see the Tree of Life,” Mat said, not taking his eyes off the halved circle above\\nthem. “We can wait that long, can’t we?”\\nThe Green Man gave Rand an odd look, then shook his head. “\\nAvendesora\\n is not here. I have not\\nrested beneath its ungentle branches in two thousand years.”\\n“The Tree of Life is not why we came,” Moiraine said firmly. She gestured to the arch. “In there,\\nis.”\\n“I will not go in with you,” the Green Man said. The butterflies around him swirled as if they\\nshared some agitation. “I was set to guard it long, long ago, but it makes me uneasy to come too close.\\nI feel myself being unmade; my end is linked with it, somehow. I remember the making of it. Some of\\nthe making. Some.” His hazelnut eyes stared, lost in memory, and he fingered his scar. “It was the first\\ndays of the Breaking of the World, when the joy of victory over the Dark One turned bitter with the\\nknowledge that all might yet be shattered by the weight of the Shadow. A hundred of them made it,\\nmen and women together. The greatest Aes Sedai works were always done so, joining \\nsaidin\\n and\\nsaidar,\\n as the True Source is joined. They died, all, to make it pure, while the world was torn around\\nthem. Knowing they would die, they charged me to guard it against the need to come. It was not what I\\nwas made for, but all was breaking apart, and they were alone, and I was all they had. It was not what\\nI was made for, but I have kept the faith.” He looked down at Moiraine, nodding to himself. “I have\\nkept faith, until it was needed. And now it ends.”\\n“You have kept the faith better than most of us who gave you the charge,” the Aes Sedai said.\\n“Perhaps it will not come as badly as you fear.”\\nThe scarred, leafy head shook slowly from side to side. “I know an ending when it comes, Aes\\nSedai. I will find another place to make things grow.” Nutbrown eyes swept sadly over the green\\nforest. “Another place, perhaps. When you come out, I will see you again, if there is time.” With that\\nhe strode away, trailing butterflies, becoming one with the forest more completely than Lan’s cloak\\never could.\\n“What did he mean?” Mat demanded. “If there’s time?”\\n“Come,” Moiraine said. And she stepped through the arch. Lan went at her heels.\\nRand was not sure what he expected when he followed. The hair stirred uneasily on his arms,\\nand rose on the back of his neck.

The smooth floor, slick to the eye like oiled slate, yet\\nsomehow gave a sure footing. Seamless, white walls glittered with uncounted flecks in untold colors,\\ngiving a low, soft light even after the sunlit archway vanished around a curve behind. He was sure the\\nlight was no natural thing, but he sensed it was benign, too. \\nThen why is your skin still crawling?\\nDown they went, and down.\\n“There,” Moiraine said at last, pointing. “Ahead.”\\nAnd the corridor opened into a vast, domed space, the rough, living rock of its ceiling dotted\\nwith clumps of glowing crystals. Below it, a pool took up the entire cavern, except for the walkway\\naround it, perhaps five paces wide. In the oval shape of an eye, the pool was lined about its rim with\\na low, flat edging of crystals that glowed with a duller, yet fiercer, light than those above. Its surface\\nwas as smooth as glass and as clear as the Winespring Water. Rand felt as if his eyes could penetrate\\nit forever, but he could not see any bottom to it.\\n“The Eye of the World,” Moiraine said softly beside him.\\nAs he looked around in wonder, he realized that the long years since the making—three thousand\\nof them—had worked their way while no one came. Not all the crystals in the dome glowed with the\\nsame intensity. Some were stronger, some weaker; some flickered, and others were only faceted\\nlumps to sparkle in a captured light. Had all shone, the dome would have been as bright as noonday,\\nbut they made it only late afternoon, now. Dust coated the walkway, and bits of stone and even\\ncrystal. Long years waiting, while the Wheel turned and ground.\\n“But \\nwhat\\n is it?” Mat asked uneasily. “That doesn’t look like any water I ever saw.” He kicked\\na lump of dark stone the size of his fist over the edge. “It—”\\nThe stone struck the glassy surface and slid into the pool without a splash, or so much as a\\nripple. As it sank, the rock began to swell, growing ever larger, larger and more attenuated, a blob the\\nsize of his head that Rand could almost see through, a faint blur as wide as his arm was long. Then it\\nwas gone. He thought his skin would creep right off his body.\\n“What is it?” he demanded, and was shocked at the hoarse harshness of his own voice.\\n“It might be called the essence of \\nsaidin.\\n” The Aes Sedai’s words echoed round the dome. “The\\nessence of the male half of the True Source, the pure essence of the Power wielded by men before the\\nTime of Madness. The Power to mend the seal on the Dark One’s prison, or to break it open\\ncompletely.”\\n“The Light shine on us and protect us,” Nynaeve whispered. Egwene clutched her as if she\\nwanted to hide behind the Wisdom. Even Lan stirred uneasily, though there was no surprise in his\\neyes.\\nStone thudded into Rand’s shoulders, and he realized he had backed as far as the wall, as far\\nfrom the Eye of the World as he could get. He would have pushed himself right through the wall, if he\\ncould have. Mat, too, was splayed out against the stone as flat as he could make himself. Perrin was\\nstaring at the pool with his axe half drawn. His eyes shone, yellow and fierce.\\n“I always wondered,” Loial said uneasily. “When I read about it, I always wondered what it\\nwas. Why? Why did they do it? And how?”\\n“No one living knows.” Moiraine no longer looked at the pool. She was watching Rand and his\\ntwo friends, studying them, her eyes weighing. “Neither the how, nor more of the why than that it\\nwould be needed one day, and that that need would be the greatest and most desperate the world had\\nfaced to that time.

He would have run if it had\\nnot meant trampling Egwene and Nynaeve, Moiraine and Lan. He could not stop shaking even when\\nhe was back outside.\\n“I do not like this, Moiraine,” Nynaeve said angrily when the sun shone on them again. “I\\nbelieve the danger is as great as you say or I would not be here, but this is—”\\n“I have found you at last.”\\nRand jerked as if a rope had tightened around his neck. The words, the voice . . . for a moment\\nhe believed it was Ba’alzamon. But the two men who walked out of the trees, faces hidden by their\\ncowls, did not wear cloaks the color of dried blood. One cloak was a dark gray, the other almost as\\ndark a green, and they seemed musty even in the open air. And the men were not Fades; the breeze\\nstirred their cloaks.\\n“Who are you?” Lan’s stance was cautious, his hand on his sword hilt. “How did you come\\nhere? If you are seeking the Green Man—”\\n“He guided us.” The hand that pointed to Mat was old and shriveled to scarcely human, lacking a\\nfingernail and with knuckles gnarled like knots in a piece of rope. Mat took a step back, eyes\\nwidening. “An old thing, an old friend, an old enemy. But he is not the one we seek,” the green-\\ncloaked man finished. The other man stood as if he would never speak.\\nMoiraine straightened to her full height, no more than shoulder high to any man there, but\\nsuddenly seeming as tall as the hills. Her voice rang like a bell, demanding, “Who are you?”\\nHands pushed back hoods, and Rand goggled. The old man was older than old; he made Cenn\\nBuie look like a child in the bloom of health. The skin of his face was like crazed parchment drawn\\ntight over a skull, then pulled tighter still. Wispy tufts of brittle hair stood at odd places on his\\nscabrous scalp. His ears were withered bits like scraps of ancient leather; his eyes sunken, peering\\nout of his head as if from the ends of tunnels. Yet the other was worse.

Her knife dropped uselessly from\\ndangling fingers as Balthamel lifted her by his grip, brought her up to where the leather mask stared\\ninto her stillquivering face. Her toes spasmed a foot above the ground; flowers rained from her hair.\\n“I have almost forgotten the pleasures of the flesh.” Aginor’s tongue crossed his withered lips,\\nsounding like stone on rough leather. “But Balthamel remembers much.” The laughter of the mask\\nseemed to grow wilder, and the wail that left Nynaeve burned Rand’s ears like despair ripped from\\nher living heart.\\nSuddenly Egwene moved, and Rand saw that she was going to help Nynaeve. “Egwene, no!” he\\nshouted, but she did not stop. His hand had gone to his sword at Nynaeve’s cry, but now he\\nabandoned it and threw himself at Egwene. He thudded into her before she took her third step,\\ncarrying them both to the ground.

I will run no more.” Ba’alzamon\\nhad a cord, too, he saw. A black cord, thicker by far than his own, so wide it should have dwarfed the\\nhuman body, yet dwarfed by Ba’alzamon, instead. Each pulse along that black vein ate light.\\n“You think it makes any difference, whether you run or stay?” The flames of Ba’alzamon’s mouth\\nlaughed.

They were looking\\nat him, the three of them. Watching. Not even blinking. He reached out to Egwene, and there was no\\nimagination in her drawing back this time. “Egwene?” She turned her face away, and he let his hand\\ndrop.\\nAbruptly she flung her arms around him, burying her face in his chest. “I’m sorry, Rand. I’m\\nsorry. I don’t care. Truly, I don’t.” Her shoulders shook. He thought she was crying. Awkwardly\\npatting her hair, he looked at the other two women over the top of her head.\\n“The Wheel weaves as the Wheel wills,” Nynaeve said slowly, “but you are still Rand al’Thor\\nof Emond’s Field. But, the Light help me, the Light help us all, you are too dangerous, Rand.” He\\nflinched from the Wisdom’s eyes, sad, regretting, and already accepting loss.\\n“What happened?” Moiraine said. “Tell me \\neverything\\n!”\\nAnd with her eyes on him, compelling, he did. He wanted to turn away, to make it short, leave\\nthings out, but the Aes Sedai’s eyes drew everything from him. Tears ran down his face when he came\\nto Kari al’Thor. His mother. He emphasized that. “He had my mother. My mother!” There was\\nsympathy and pain on Nynaeve’s face, but the Aes Sedai’s eyes drove him on, to the sword of Light,\\nto severing the black cord, and the flames consuming Ba’alzamon. Egwene’s arms tightened around\\nhim as if she would pull him back from what had happened. “But it wasn’t me,” he finished. “The\\nLight . . . pulled me along. It wasn’t really me. Doesn’t that make any difference?”\\n“I had suspicions from the first,” Moiraine said. “Suspicions are not proof, though. After I gave\\nyou the token, the coin, and made that bonding, you should have been willing to fall in with Whatever\\nI wanted, but you resisted, questioned. That told me something, but not enough. Manetheren blood was\\nalways stubborn, and more so after Aemon died and Eldrene’s heart was shattered. Then there was\\nBela.”\\n“Bela?” he said. \\nNothing makes any difference.\\nThe Aes Sedai nodded. “At Watch Hill, Bela had no need of me to cleanse her of tiredness;\\nsomeone had already done it. She could have outrun Mandarb, that night. I should have thought of who\\nBela carried. With Trollocs on our heels, a Draghkar overhead, and a Halfman the Light alone knew\\nwhere, how you must have feared that Egwene would be left behind. You needed something more than\\nyou had ever needed anything before in your life, and you reached out to the one thing that could give\\nit to you. \\nSaidin.\\n”\\nHe shivered. He felt so cold his fingers hurt. “If I never do it again, if I never touch it again, I\\nwon’t. . . .” He could not say it. Go mad. Turn the land and people around him to madness. Die,\\nrotting while he still lived.\\n“Perhaps,” Moiraine said. “It would be much easier if there was someone to teach you, but it\\nmight be done, with a supreme effort of will.”\\n“You can teach me. Surely, you—” He stopped when the Aes Sedai shook her head.\\n“Can a cat teach a dog to climb trees, Rand? Can a fish teach a bird to swim?

Perhaps your will is strong enough.”\\nEgwene straightened, wiping reddened eyes with the back of her hand. She looked as if she\\nwanted to say something, but when she opened her mouth, nothing came out. \\nAt least she isn’t pulling\\naway. At least she can look at me without screaming.\\n“The others?” he said.\\n“Lan took them into the cavern,” Nynaeve said. “The Eye is gone, but there’s something in the\\nmiddle of the pool, a crystal column, and steps to reach it.

Will they scream and run away like I’m a Fade?\\n Moiraine spoke as if she did not notice the\\nblood draining from his face.\\n“There was a vast amount of the One Power in the Eye. Even in the Age of Legends, few could\\nhave channeled so much unaided without being destroyed. Very few.”\\n“You told them?” he said hoarsely. “If everybody knows. . . .”\\n“Only Lan,” Moiraine said gently. “He must know. And Nynaeve and Egwene, for what they are\\nand what they will become. The others have no need, yet.”\\n“Why not?” The rasp in his throat made his voice harsh. “You will be wanting to gentle me,\\nwon’t you? Isn’t that what Aes Sedai do to men who can wield the Power?

He named names, and I remember them, now. Raolin Darksbane and Guaire Amalasan.\\nYurian Stonebow. Davian. Logain.” The last was the hardest of all to say. Nynaeve went pale and\\nEgwene gasped, but he pressed on angrily. “Every one a false Dragon. Don’t try to deny it. Well, I\\nwon’t be used. I am not a tool you can throw on the midden heap when it’s worn out.”\\n“A tool made for a purpose is not demeaned by being used for that purpose,” Moiraine’s voice\\nwas as harsh as his own, “but a man who believes the Father of Lies demeans himself. You say you\\nwill not be used, and then you let the Dark One set your path like a hound sent after a rabbit by his\\nmaster.”\\nHis fists clenched, and he turned his head away. It was too close to the things Ba’alzamon had\\nsaid. “I am no one’s hound. Do you hear me? No one’s!”\\nLoial and the others appeared in the arch, and Rand scrambled to his feet, looking at Moiraine.\\n“They will not know,” the Aes Sedai said, “until the Pattern makes it so.”\\nThen his friends were coming close. Lan led the way, looking as hard as ever but still somewhat\\nthe worse for wear. He had one of Nynaeve’s bandages around his temples, and a stiffbacked way of\\nwalking. Behind him, Loial carried a large gold chest, ornately worked and chased with silver. No\\none but an Ogier could have lifted it unaided. Perrin had his arms wrapped around a big bundle of\\nfolded white cloth, and Mat was cupping what appeared to be fragments of pottery in his two hands.\\n“So you’re alive after all.” Mat laughed. His face darkened, and he jerked his head at Moiraine.\\n“She wouldn’t let us look for you. Said we had to find out what the Eye was hiding. I’d have gone\\nanyway, but Nynaeve and Egwene sided with her and almost threw me through the arch.”\\n“You’re here, now,” Perrin said, “and not too badly beaten about, by the look of you.” His eyes\\ndid not glow, but the irises were all yellow, now. “That’s the important thing. You’re here, and we’re\\ndone with what we came for, Whatever it was. Moiraine Sedai says we’re done, and we can go.\\nHome, Rand. The Light burn me, but I want to go home.”\\n“Good to see you alive, sheepherder,” Lan said gruffly. “I see you hung onto your sword. Maybe\\nyou’ll learn to use it, now.” Rand felt a sudden burst of affection for the Warder; Lan knew, but on the\\nsurface at least, nothing had changed.

The Warder is the only one of these three who cares much at\\nall for books, and he won’t talk. What happened to you? We all ran off and hid in the woods until\\nMoiraine Sedai sent Lan to find us, but she would not let us look for you. Why were you gone so long,\\nRand?”\\n“I ran and ran,” he said slowly, “until I fell down a hill and hit my head on a rock. I think I hit\\nevery rock on the way down.” That should explain his bruises. He tried to watch the Aes Sedai, and\\nNynaeve and Egwene, too, but their faces never changed. “When I came to, I was lost, and finally I\\nstumbled back here. I think Aginor is dead, burned. I found some ashes, and pieces of his cloak.”\\nThe lies sounded hollow in his ears. He could not understand why they did not laugh with scorn\\nand demand the truth, but his friends nodded, accepting, and made sympathetic sounds as they\\ngathered around the Aes Sedai to show her what they had found.\\n“Help me up,” Moiraine said. Nynaeve and Egwene lifted her until she was sitting; they had to\\nsupport her even then.\\n“How could these things be inside the Eye,” Mat asked, “without being destroyed like that\\nrock?”\\n“They were not put there to be destroyed,” the Aes Sedai said curtly, and frowned away their\\nquestions while she took the pottery fragments, black and white and shiny, from Mat.\\nThey seemed like rubble to Rand, but she fitted them together deftly on the ground beside her,\\nmaking a perfect circle the size of a man’s hand. The ancient symbol of the Aes Sedai, the Flame of\\nTar Valon joined with the Dragon’s Fang, black siding white. For a moment Moiraine only looked at\\nit, her face unreadable, then she took the knife from her belt and handed it to Lan, nodding to the\\ncircle.\\nThe Warder separated out the largest piece, then raised the knife high and brought it down with\\nall his might. A spark flew, the fragment leaped with the force of the blow, and the blade snapped\\nwith a sharp crack. He examined the stump left attached to the hilt, then tossed it aside. “The best\\nsteel from Tear,” he said dryly.\\nMat snatched the fragment up and grunted, then showed it around. There was no mark on it.\\n“Cuendillar,”\\n Moiraine said. “Heartstone. No one has been able to make it since the Age of\\nLegends, and even then it was made only for the greatest purpose. Once made, nothing can break it.\\nNot the One Power itself wielded by the greatest Aes Sedai who ever lived aided by the most\\npowerful \\nsa’angreal\\n ever made. Any power directed against heartstone only makes it stronger.”\\n“Then how . . . ?” Mat’s gesture with the piece he held took in the other bits on the ground.\\n“This was one of the seven seals on the Dark One’s prison,” Moiraine said. Mat dropped the\\npiece as if it had become white-hot. For a moment, Perrin’s eyes seemed to glow again. The Aes\\nSedai calmly began gathering the fragments.\\n“It doesn’t matter anymore,” Rand said. His friends looked at him oddly, and he wished he had\\nkept his mouth shut.\\n“Of course,” Moiraine replied. But she carefully put all the pieces into her pouch. “Bring me the\\nchest.” Loial lifted it closer.\\nThe flattened cube of gold and silver appeared to be solid, but the Aes Sedai’s fingers felt\\nacross the intricate work, pressing, and with a sudden click a top flung back as if on springs. A\\ncurled, gold horn nestled within. Despite its gleam, it seemed plain beside the chest that held it. The'),\n",

His\\neyes went wider and wider, and his ears stood up straight. \\n“Tia mi aven Moridin isainde vadin,”\\n he\\nwhispered. “The grave is no bar to my call.”\\n“The Horn of Valere.” For once the Warder appeared truly shaken; there was a touch of awe in\\nhis voice.\\nAt the same time Nynaeve said in a shaky voice, “To call the heroes of the Ages back from the\\ndead to fight the Dark One.”\\n“Burn me!” Mat breathed.\\nLoial reverently laid the horn back in its golden nest. “I begin to wonder,” Moiraine said. “The\\nEye of the World was made against the greatest need the world would ever face, but was it made for\\nthe use to which . . . we . . . put it, or to guard these things? Quickly, the last, show it to me.”\\nAfter the first two, Rand could understand Perrin’s reluctance. Lan and the Ogier took the bundle\\nof white cloth from him when he hesitated, and unfolded it between them. A long, white banner\\nspread out, lifting on the air. Rand could only stare. The whole thing seemed of a piece, neither\\nwoven, nor dyed, nor painted. A figure like a serpent, scaled in scarlet and gold, ran the entire length,\\nbut it had scaled legs, and feet with five long, golden claws on each, and a great head with a golden\\nmane and eyes like the sun. The stirring of the banner made it seem to move, scales glittering like\\nprecious metals and gems, alive, and he almost thought he could hear it roar defiance.\\n“What is it?” he said.\\nMoiraine answered slowly. “The banner of the Lord of the Morning when he led the forces of\\nlight against the Shadow. The banner of Lews Therin Telamon. The banner of the Dragon.” Loial\\nalmost dropped his end.\\n“Burn me!” Mat said faintly.\\n“We will take these things with us when we go,” Moiraine said. “They were not put here by\\nchance, and I must know more.” Her fingers brushed her pouch, where the pieces of the shattered seal\\nwere. “It is too late in the day for starting now. We will rest, and eat, but we will leave early. The\\nBlight is all around here, not as along the Border, and strong. Without the Green Man, this place\\ncannot hold long. Let me down,” she told Nynaeve and Egwene. “I must rest.”\\nRand became aware of what he had been seeing all along, but not noticing. Dead, brown leaves\\nfalling from the great oak. Dead leaves rustling thick on the ground in the breeze, brown mixed with\\npetals dropped from thousands of flowers. The Green Man had held back the Blight, but already the\\nBlight was killing what he had made.\\n“It is done, isn’t it?” he asked Moiraine. “It is finished.”\\nThe Aes Sedai turned her head on its pillow of cloaks.

A litter, fashioned by\\nLan, was slung between the shaggy mare and Aldieb, to carry Moiraine; Nynaeve would ride beside\\nwith the white mare’s reins. The Wisdom dropped her eyes whenever she saw Lan glance at her,\\navoiding his gaze; the Warder looked at her whenever her eyes were averted, but he would not speak\\nto her. No one had to ask who Egwene meant.\\n“It is not right,” Loial said, staring at the oak. The Ogier was the only one still not mounted. “It is\\nnot right that Treebrother should fall to the Blight.” He handed the reins of his big horse to Rand. “Not\\nright.”\\nLan opened his mouth as the Ogier walked to the great oak.

They crested a\\nhill, and in an eyeblink the Blight was all around them, twisted and rotted in virulent rainbow hues.\\nRand looked over his shoulder, but the Green Man’s garden was nowhere to be seen. Only the Blight\\nstretching behind them as before. Yet he thought, just for a moment, that he saw the towering top of the\\noak tree, green and lush, before it shimmered and was gone. Then there was only the Blight.\\nHe half expected they would have to fight their way out as they fought their way in, but the Blight\\nwas as quiet and still as death. Not a single branch trembled as if to lash at them, nothing screamed or\\nhowled, neither nearby nor in the distance. The Blight seemed to crouch, not to pounce, but as if it had\\nbeen struck a great blow and waited for the next to fall. Even the sun was less red.\\nWhen they passed the necklace of lakes, the sun hung not far past its zenith. Lan kept them well\\naway from the lakes and did not even look at them, but Rand thought the seven towers seemed taller\\nthan when he first saw them. He was sure the jagged tops were further from the ground, and above\\nthem something almost seen, seamless towers gleaming in the sun, and banners with Golden Cranes\\nflying on the wind. He blinked and stared, but the towers refused to vanish completely. They were\\nthere at the edge of vision until the Blight hid the lakes once more.\\nBefore sunset the Warder chose a campsite, and Moiraine had Nynaeve and Egwene help her up\\nto set wards. The Aes Sedai whispered in the other women’s ears before she began. Nynaeve\\nhesitated, but when Moiraine closed her eyes, all three women did so together.\\nRand saw Mat and Perrin staring, and wondered how they could be surprised. \\nEvery woman is\\nan Aes Sedai,\\n he thought mirthlessly. \\nThe Light help me, so am I.\\n Bleakness held his tongue.\\n“Why is it so different?” Perrin asked as Egwene and the Wisdom helped Moiraine to her bed.\\n“It feels. . . .” His thick shoulders shrugged as if he could not find the word.\\n“We struck a mighty blow at the Dark One,” Moiraine replied, settling herself with a sigh. “The\\nShadow will be a long time recovering.”\\n“How?” Mat demanded. “What did we do?”\\n“Sleep,” Moiraine said. “We are not out of the Blight yet.”\\nBut the next morning, still nothing changed that Rand could see. The Blight faded as they rode\\nsouth, of course. Twisted trees were replaced by straight. The stifling heat diminished. Rotting\\nfoliage gave way to the merely diseased.

He wore a troubled frown that deepened when he saw Moiraine\\ncarried in on her litter by liveried servants. Women in the black-and-gold fluttered over bringing the\\nAes Sedai to him without a chance to freshen herself or be brought the healer. Loial carried the gold\\nchest. The pieces of the seal were still in Moiraine’s pouch; Lews Therin Kinslayer’s banner was\\nwrapped in her blanketroll and still tied behind Aldieb’s saddle. The groom who had led the white\\nmare away had received the strictest orders to see the blanketroll was placed untouched in the\\nchambers assigned to the Aes Sedai.\\n“Peace!” the Lord of Fal Dara muttered. “Are you injured, Moiraine Sedai?

Never think the need for watchfulness in the\\nBorderlands is gone.”\\n“I did not think it so, Aes Sedai,” he said stiffly.\\nMoiraine motioned for Loial to set the gold chest at her feet, and when he did, she opened it,\\nrevealing the horn. “The Horn of Valere,” she said, and Agelmar gasped. Rand almost thought the man\\nwould kneel.\\n“With that, Moiraine Sedai, it matters not how many Halfmen or Trollocs remain. With the\\nheroes of old come back from the tomb, we will march to the Blasted Lands and level Shayol Ghul.”\\n“NO!” Agelmar’s mouth fell open in surprise, but Moiraine continued calmly. “I did not show it\\nto you to taunt you, but so that you will know that in Whatever battles yet come, our might will be as\\ngreat as that of the Shadow. Its place is not here. The Horn must be carried to Illian. It is there, if\\nfresh battles threaten, that it must rally the forces of the Light. I will ask an escort of your best men to\\nsee that it reaches Illian safely. There are Darkfriends still, as well as Halfmen and Trollocs, and\\nthose who come to the horn will follow whoever winds it.

Many records were destroyed in the Trolloc Wars, so much so\\nthat with the end of the Wars there was argument about the exact year under the old system. A new\\ncalendar was proposed by Tiam of Gazar, celebrating the supposed freedom from the Trolloc threat\\nand recording each year as a Free Year (FY). The Gazaran Calendar gained wide acceptance within\\ntwenty years after the Wars’ end. Artur Hawkwing attempted to establish a new calendar based on the\\nfounding of his empire (FF, From the Founding), but this is now known and referred to only by\\nhistorians. After the widespread destruction, death and disruption of the War of the Hundred Years, a\\nfourth calendar was devised by Uren din Jubai Soaring Gull, a scholar of the Sea Folk, and\\npromulgated by the Panarch Farede of Tarabon. The Farede Calendar, dating from the arbitrarily\\ndecided end of the War of the Hundred Years and recording years of the New Era (NE), is currently\\nin use.\\n \\nAdan, Heran\\n \\n(ay-DAN, HEH-ran)\\n:\\n Governor of Baerlon.\\nAes Sedai\\n \\n(EYEZ seh-DEYE)\\n:\\n Wielders of the One Power.

His grimace was hidden by the black\\nsilk mask that covered his face, though, just like the masks that covered the hundred other faces in the\\nchamber. A hundred black masks, and a hundred pairs of eyes trying to see what lay behind them.\\nIf one did not look too closely, the huge room could have been in a palace, with its tall marble\\nfireplaces and its golden lamps hanging from the domed ceiling, its colorful tapestries and intricately\\npatterned mosaic floor. If one did not look too closely. The fireplaces were cold, for one thing.\\nFlames danced on logs as thick as a man’s leg, but gave no heat. The walls behind the tapestries, the\\nceiling high above the lamps, were undressed stone, almost black. There were no windows, and only\\ntwo doorways, one at either end of the room. It was as if someone had intended to give the semblance\\nof a palace reception chamber but had not cared enough to bother with more than the outline and a\\nfew touches for detail.\\nWhere the chamber was, the man who called himself Bors did not know, nor did he think any of\\nthe others knew. He did not like to think about where it might be. It was enough that he had been\\nsummoned. He did not like to think about that, either, but for such a summons, even he came.\\nHe shifted his cloak, thankful that the fires were cold, else it would have been too hot for the\\nblack wool draping him to the floor. All his clothes were black. The bulky folds of the cloak hid the\\nstoop he used to disguise his height, and bred confusion as to whether he was thin or thick. He was\\nnot the only one there enveloped in a tailor’s span of cloth.\\nSilently he watched his companions. Patience had marked much of his life. Always, if he waited\\nand watched long enough, someone made a mistake. Most of the men and women here might have had\\nthe same philosophy; they watched, and listened silently to those who had to speak. Some people\\ncould not bear waiting, or silence, and so gave away more than they knew.\\nServants circulated through the guests, slender, golden-haired youths proffering wine with a bow\\nand a wordless smile. Young men and young women alike, they wore tight white breeches and\\nflowing white shirts. And male and female alike, they moved with disturbing grace. Each looked\\nmore than a mirror image of the others, the boys as handsome as the girls were beautiful. He doubted\\nhe could distinguish one from another, and he had an eye and a memory for faces.\\nA smiling, white-clad girl offered her tray of crystal goblets to him.

Blank eyes. Empty eyes. A doll’s eyes. Eyes more dead than death.\\nHe shivered as she moved gracefully away, and raised the goblet to his lips before he caught\\nhimself. It was not what had been done to the girl that chilled him. Rather, every time he thought he\\ndetected a weakness in those he now served, he found himself preceded, the supposed weakness cut\\nout with a ruthless precision that left him amazed. And worried. The first rule of his life had always\\nbeen to search for weakness, for every weakness was a chink where he could probe and pry and\\ninfluence. If his current masters, his masters for the moment, had no weakness. . . .\\nFrowning behind his mask, he studied his companions. At least there was plenty of weakness\\nthere. Their nervousness betrayed them, even those who had sense enough to guard their tongues. A\\nstiffness in the way this one held himself, a jerkiness in the way that one handled her skirts.\\nA good quarter of them, he estimated, had not bothered with disguise beyond the black masks.\\nTheir clothes told much. A woman standing before a gold-and-crimson wall hanging, speaking softly\\nto a figure—impossible to say whether it were man or woman—cloaked and hooded in gray. She had\\nobviously chosen the spot because the colors of the tapestry set off her garb. Doubly foolish to draw\\nattention to herself, for her scarlet dress, cut low in the bodice to show too much flesh and high at the\\nhem to display golden slippers, marked her from Illian, and a woman of wealth, perhaps even of\\nnoble blood.\\nNot far beyond the Illianer, another woman stood, alone and admirably silent. With a swan’s\\nneck and lustrous black hair falling in waves below her waist, she kept her back to the stone wall,\\nobserving everything. No nervousness there, only serene self-possession. Very admirable, that, but\\nher coppery skin and her creamy, high-necked gown—leaving nothing buther hands uncovered, yet\\nclinging and only just barely opaque, so that it hinted at everything and revealed nothing—marked her\\njust as clearly of the first blood of Arad Doman. And unless the man who called himself Bors missed\\nhis guess entirely, the wide golden bracelet on her left wrist bore her House symbols. They would be\\nfor her own House; no Domani bloodborn would bend her stiff pride enough to wear the sigils of\\nanother House. Worse than foolishness.\\nA man in a high-collared, sky-blue Shienaran coat passed him with a wary, head-to-toe glance\\nthrough the eyeholes of his mask. The man’s carriage named him soldier; the set of his shoulders, the\\nway his gaze never rested in one place for long, and the way his hand seemed ready to dart for a\\nsword that was not there, all proclaimed it. The Shienaran wasted little time on the man who called\\nhimself Bors; stooped shoulders and a bent back held no threat.\\nThe man who called himself Bors snorted as the Shienaran moved on, right hand clenching and\\neyes already studying elsewhere for danger. He could read them all, to class and country. Merchant\\nand warrior, commoner and noble. From Kandor and Cairhien, Saldaea and Ghealdan. From every\\nnation and nearly every people. His nose wrinkled in sudden disgust.

Surely none of his companions, lying on their bellies\\nwith their masked faces pressed to the mosaic tiles, would have spoken, but it was not the voice he\\nexpected from. . . . Cautiously, he raised his head enough to see with one eye.\\nThe figure of a man floated in the air above the Myrddraal, the hem of his blood red robe\\nhanging a span over the Halfman’s head. Masked in blood red, too. Would the Great Lord of the Dark\\nappear to them as a man? And masked, besides? Yet the Myrddraal, its very gaze fear, trembled and\\nalmost cowered where it stood in the figure’s shadow. The man who called himself Bors grasped for\\nan answer his mind could contain without splitting. One of the Forsaken, perhaps.\\nThat thought was only a little less painful. Even so, it meant the Day of the Dark One’s return\\nmust be close at hand if one of the Forsaken was free. The Forsaken, thirteen of the most powerful\\nwielders of the One Power in an Age filled with powerful wielders, had been sealed up in Shayol\\nGhul along with the Dark One, sealed away from the world of men by the Dragon and the Hundred\\nCompanions. And the backblast of that sealing had tainted the male half of the True Source; and all\\nthe male Aes Sedai, those cursed wielders of the Power, went mad and broke the world, tore it apart\\nlike a pottery bowl smashed on rocks, ending the Age of Legends before they died, rotting while they\\nstill lived. A fitting death for Aes Sedai, to his mind. Too good for them. He regretted only that the\\nwomen had been spared.\\nSlowly, painfully, he forced the panic to the back of his mind, confined it and held it tight though\\nit screamed to get out. It was the best he could do. None of those on their bellies had risen, and only a\\nfew had even dared raise their heads.\\n“Rise.” There was a snap in the red-masked figure’s voice this time. He gestured with both\\nhands. “Stand!”\\nThe man who called himself Bors scrambled up awkwardly, but halfway to his feet, he hesitated.\\nThose gesturing hands were horribly burned, crisscrossed by black fissures, the raw flesh between as\\nred as the figure’s robes. \\nWould the Dark One appear so? Or even one of the Forsaken?\\n The\\neyeholes of that blood red mask swept slowly across him, and he straightened hastily. He thought he\\ncould feel the heat of an open furnace in that gaze.\\nThe others obeyed the command with no more grace and no less fear in their rising. When all\\nwere on their feet, the floating figure spoke.\\n“I have been known by many names, but the one by which you shall know me is Ba’alzamon.”\\nThe man who called himself Bors clamped his teeth to keep them from chattering. Ba’alzamon.'),\n",

His breath whistled through his nostrils, and all around him he could hear\\nothers panting behind their masks. The servants were gone, and the Trollocs as well, though he had\\nnot seen them go.\\n“The place where you stand lies in the shadow of Shayol Ghul.” More than one voice moaned at\\nthat; the man who called himself Bors was not sure his own was not among them. A touch of what\\nmight almost be called mockery entered Ba’alzamon’s voice as he spread his arms wide. “Fear not,\\nfor the Day of your Master’s rising upon the world is near at hand.

So have I promised, and so shall it be, without end.\\nYou shall live and rule forever.”\\nA murmur of anticipation ran through the listeners, and some even took a step forward, toward\\nthe floating, crimson shape, their eyes lifted, rapturous. Even the man who called himself Bors felt the\\npull of that promise, the promise for which he had dealt away his soul a hundred times over.\\n“The Day of Return comes closer,” Ba’alzamon said. “But there is much yet to do. Much to do.”\\nThe air to Ba’alzamon’s left shimmered and thickened, and the figure of a young man hung there,\\na little lower than Ba’alzamon. The man who called himself Bors could not decide whether it was a\\nliving being or not. A country lad, by his clothes, with a light of mischief in his brown eyes and the\\nhint of a smile on his lips, as if in memory or anticipation of a prank. The flesh looked warm, but the\\nchest did not move with breath, the eyes did not blink.\\nThe air to Ba’alzamon’s right wavered as if with heat, and a second country-clad figure hung\\nsuspended a little below Ba’alzamon. A curly-haired youth, as heavily muscled as a blacksmith. And\\nan oddity: a battleaxe hung at his side, a great, steel half-moon balanced by a thick spike. The man\\nwho called himself Bors suddenly leaned forward, intent on an even greater strangeness. A youth with\\nyellow eyes.\\nFor the third time air solidified into the shape of a young man, this time directly under\\nBa’alzamon’s eye, almost at his feet. A tall fellow, with eyes now gray, now almost blue as the light\\ntook them, and dark, reddish hair. Another villager, or farmer. The man who called himself Bors\\ngasped. Yet another thing out of the ordinary, though he wondered why he should expect anything to\\nbe ordinary here. A sword swung from the figure’s belt, a sword with a bronze heron on the scabbard\\nand another inset into the long, two-handed hilt. \\nA\\n village boy \\nwith a heron-mark blade? Impossible!\\nWhat can it mean? And a boy with\\n yellow \\neyes.\\n He noticed the Myrddraal looking at the figures,\\ntrembling; and unless he misjudged entirely, its trembling was no longer fear, but hatred.\\nDead silence had fallen, silence that Ba’alzamon let deepen before he spoke. “There is now one\\nwho walks the world, one who was and will be, but is not yet, the Dragon.”\\nA startled murmur ran through his listeners.\\n“The Dragon Reborn! We are to kill him, Great Lord?” That from the Shienaran, hand grasping\\neagerly at his side where his sword would hang.\\n“Perhaps,” Ba’alzamon said simply. “And perhaps not. Perhaps he can be turned to my use.\\nSooner or later it will be so, in this Age or another.”'),\n",

With her hands spread over her bosom as if\\nto hide the rounded flesh she exposed, eyes wide, half frightened and half ecstatic, she was nodding\\neagerly as though to someone face-to-face with her. Sometimes she appeared to give a reply, but the\\nman who called himself Bors heard not a word. Suddenly she arched backwards, trembling and rising\\non her toes. He could not see why she did not fall, unless something unseen held her. Then, just as\\nabruptly, she settled back to her feet and nodded again, bowing, shivering. Even as she straightened,\\none of the women wearing a Great Serpent ring gave a start and began nodding.\\nSo each of us hears his own instructions, and none hears another’s.\\n The man who called\\nhimself Bors muttered in frustration. If he knew what even one other was commanded, he might be\\nable to use the knowledge to advantage, but this way. . . .

The man of the Atha’an Miere, the Sea Folk, stiffening with\\nreluctance as he nodded. The Shienaran, his stance be speaking confusion even while he acquiesced.\\nThe second woman of Tar Valon giving a start, as of shock, and the gray-swathed figure whose sex he\\ncould not determine shaking its head before falling to its knees and nodding vigorously. Some\\nunderwent the same convulsion as the Illianer woman, as if pain itself lifted them to toe tips.\\n“Bors.”\\nThe man who called himself Bors jerked as a red mask filled his eyes. He could still see the\\nroom, still see the floating shape of Ba’alzamon and the three figures before him, but at the same time\\nall he could see was the red-masked face. Dizzy, he felt as if his skull were splitting open and his\\neyes were being pushed out of his head. For a moment he thought he could see flames through the\\neyeholes of the mask.\\n“Are you faithful . . . Bors?”\\nThe hint of mocking in the name sent a chill down his backbone. “I am faithful, Great Lord. I\\ncannot hide from you.” \\nI\\n am \\nfaithful! I swear it!\\n“No, you cannot.”\\nThe certainty in Ba’alzamon’s voice dried his mouth, but he forced himself to speak. “Command\\nme, Great Lord, and I obey.”\\n“Firstly, you are to return to Tarabon and continue your \\ngood\\n works. In fact, I command you to\\nredouble your efforts.”\\nHe stared at Ba’alzamon in puzzlement, but then fires flared again behind the mask, and he took\\nthe excuse of a bow to pull his eyes away. “As you command, Great Lord, so shall it be.”\\n“Secondly, you will watch for the three young men, and have your followers watch.

An\\narmored man in a brutal helm, shaped and painted and gilded like some monstrous, poisonous insect,\\nraised a sword and plunged to one side, beyond his view. A horn, curled and golden, came hurtling\\nout of the far distance. One piercing note it sounded as it flashed toward him, tugging his soul. At the\\nlast instant it flashed into a blinding, golden ring of light that passed through him, chilling him beyond\\ndeath. A wolf leaped from the shadows of lost sight and ripped out his throat. He could not scream.\\nThe torrent went on, drowning him, burying him. He could barely remember who he was, or what he\\nwas. The skies rained fire, and the moon and stars fell; rivers ran in blood, and the dead walked; the\\nearth split open and fountained molten rock. . . .\\nThe man who called himself Bors found himself half crouching in the chamber with the others,\\nmost watching him, all silent. Wherever he looked, up or down or in any direction, the masked face of\\nBa’alzamon overwhelmed his eyes.

Someone will come soon to show you the way.”\\nUntouched by any visible hand, the door swung shut.\\nThe man who called himself Bors shivered in spite of himself. Hastily he undid the seals and\\nbuckles of his saddlebags and pulled out his usual cloak. In the back of his mind a small voice\\nwondered if the promised power, even the immortality, was worth another meeting like this, but he\\nlaughed it down immediately. \\nFor that much power, I would praise the Great Lord of the Dark\\nunder the Dome of Truth.\\n Remembering the commands given him by Ba’alzamon, he fingered the\\ngolden, flaring sun worked on the breast of the white cloak, and the red shepherd’s crook behind the\\nsun, symbol of his office in the world of men, and he almost laughed.
